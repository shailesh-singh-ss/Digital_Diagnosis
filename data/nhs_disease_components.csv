abdominal aortic aneurysm,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cardiovascular-disease/heart-disease/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/,"[{'about abdominal aortic aneurysms': ' an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta – the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body. the abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide – roughly the width of a garden hose. however, it can swell to over 5.5cm – what doctors class as a large aaa. large aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. if a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal. the bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm. aaas are most common in men aged over 65. a rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group. this is why all men are invited for a\xa0screening test when they turn 65. the test involves a simple ultrasound scan, which takes around 10-15 minutes.'}, {'symptoms of an aaa': ' in most cases, an aaa causes no noticeable symptoms. however, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their\xa0abdomen (tummy)\xa0or persistent back pain. an aaa doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there’s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture). a ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don’t survive surgery. the most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen. if you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.'}, {'causes of an aaa': ' it’s not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors. there are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level. having a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself.'}, {'diagnosing an aaa': ' because aaas usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination – for example, if a gp notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen. the screening test is an\xa0ultrasound scan,\xa0which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. this is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one.'}, {'treating an aaa': ' if a large aaa is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent\xa0it rupturing. this is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing. if surgery is not advisable – or if you decide not to have it – there are a number of non-surgical treatments that can reduce the risk of an aneurysm rupturing. they include medications to lower\xa0your cholesterol and blood pressure, and quitting smoking. you will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning.'}, {'prevention': ' the best way to prevent getting an aneurysm – or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing – is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as:smoking eating a high-fat diet not exercising regularly being overweight or obese '}, {'screening': ' read more about screening for an aaa.'}, {'symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm': ' in most cases, an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) will cause no symptoms, unless it becomes particularly large. symptoms of an unruptured aaa may include:a pulsating feeling in your stomach (abdomen), usually near your belly button, that’s usually only noticeable when you touch it persistent back pain persistent abdominal pain if you have any of the symptoms above, you should see your gp as soon as possible.'}, {'ruptured aaa': ' if your aortic aneurysm ruptures, you will feel a sudden and severe pain in the middle or side of your abdomen. in men, the pain can also radiate down into the scrotum. other symptoms include:dizziness sweaty and clammy skin rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) shortness of breath feeling faint loss of consciousness'}, {'medical emergency': ' a ruptured aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency, and it’s important to get to hospital as soon as possible. around 80% of people with a rupture die before they reach hospital or don’t survive emergency surgery. this is why the\xa0nhs aaa screening programme was introduced, so dangerously large aneurysms can be treated before they burst. if you suspect that you or someone in your care has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.'}, {'causes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm': ' the aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. it transports oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) occurs when part of the aorta wall becomes weakened and the large amount of blood that passes through it puts pressure on the weak spot, causing it to bulge outwards to form an aneurysm. the abdominal aorta is usually around 2cm wide – about the width of a garden hosepipe \xa0– but can swell to over 5.5cm, which is what doctors classify as a large aneurysm.'}, {'risk factors for an aaa': ' it’s not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors. one study found that people aged over 75 are seven times more likely to be diagnosed with an aaa than people under 55 years old. men are around six times more likely to be diagnosed with an aaa than women. however, there are other risk factors that you can do something about – described below – the most important of which is smoking.'}, {'diagnosing an abdominal aortic aneurysm': ' an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) usually causes no symptoms. therefore, they tend to be diagnosed as a result of screening, or during a routine physical examination when a gp notices a distinctive pulsating sensation in your abdomen. a diagnosis can be confirmed using an ultrasound scan. ultrasound can also determine the size of the aneurysm, which is an important factor in deciding on a course of treatment.'}, {'screening': ' all men in the uk who are 65 or over are offered an\xa0ultrasound scan to check for aaas. all men should receive an invitation in the year they turn 65 years old. men who are older than 65 can refer themselves for screening by contacting their local nhs aaa screening service. for more information, visit our page on\xa0aaa screening.'}, {'treating an abdominal aortic aneurysm': ' treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) depends on several factors, including the aneurysm’s size, your age and general health. in general, if you have a large aneurysm (5.5cm or larger) you will be advised to have surgery, either to strengthen the swollen section of the aorta or to replace it with a piece of synthetic tubing. this is because the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is usually greater than the risk of having it repaired. if you have a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you will be offered regular scans to check its size. you will also be given advice on how to slow its growth and reduce the risk of it rupturing\xa0–\xa0for example, stopping smoking – and perhaps medications to reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol level.'}, {'if you have a large aaa': ' if you are diagnosed with an aaa that is 5.5cm or larger, you will be referred to a vascular surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in diseases of the blood vessels), who may recommend an operation. the surgeon will discuss treatment options with you, taking into account your general health and fitness, as well as the size of your aneurysm. if it’s decided that surgery isn’t suitable for you, it’s still possible to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting, and you will have regular scans to check its size – in the same way people with small or medium aneurysms are treated. see below for more information on treating small and medium aneurysms. there are two surgical techniques used to treat a large aneurysm:endovascular surgery open surgery although both techniques are equally effective at reducing the risk of the aneurysm bursting, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. the surgeon will discuss with you which is most suitable.'}, {'if you have a small or medium aaa': ' if you are diagnosed with a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you won’t be referred to see a vascular surgeon, as it’s unlikely you’d benefit from surgery. you’ll be invited back for regular scans to check the size of the aneurysm, in case it gets bigger – every year if you have a small aneurysm and every three months if you have a medium aneurysm. you will also be given advice on how to prevent the aneurysm from getting bigger, including:stopping smoking eating a balanced diet ensuring you maintain a healthy weight taking regular exercise if you smoke, the most important change you can make is to quit. aneurysms have been shown to grow faster in smokers than in non-smokers. read more about\xa0stopping smoking and\xa0nicotine replacement therapies (nrts) that can make it easier to stop smoking. your gp will be sent your test result and may decide to change your current medication or start you on a new one, especially if you have:high blood pressure\xa0– which you will probably be treated for with a medication called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor high cholesterol\xa0– which you will probably be treated for with a medication called a statin'}, {'treating a ruptured aaa': ' emergency treatment for a ruptured aaa is based on the same principle as preventative treatment. grafts are used to repair the ruptured aneurysm. the decision on whether to perform open or endovascular surgery is made on a case-by-case basis by the surgeon carrying out the operation.'}, {'preventing an abdominal aortic aneurysm': ' the best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels. this includes:smoking eating a high-fat diet not exercising regularly being overweight or obese if your gp finds out you have high blood pressure or a high cholesterol level, you may be prescribed medication for both. this will reduce the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa).'}, {'smoking': ' smoking is a major risk factor for aneurysms because it causes atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and raises your blood pressure. tobacco smoke contains substances that can damage the walls of the arteries. it is known that smokers are seven times more likely than non-smokers to develop an aaa. the more you smoke, the greater your risk. people who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers. if you want to stop smoking, your gp will be able to refer you to an nhs stop smoking service, which will give you dedicated help and advice about the best ways to quit. you can also call or chat online with quit your way scotland.\xa0the specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement. read more about\xa0stopping smoking and\xa0nicotine replacement therapies (nrts), which can make it easier to quit.'}, {'diet': ' eating a high-fat diet increases your risk of atherosclerosis. it’s especially important to limit the amount of foods you eat that are high in saturated fat, such as biscuits, cakes, butter, sausages and bacon. this is because eating too much saturated fat can lead to high cholesterol, which can build up in the artery walls. read more about high cholesterol. find out more about\xa0healthy eating and how to reduce the amount of saturated fat you eat.'}, {'exercise': ' being active and doing regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. regular exercise can also help you lose weight, which will also help lower your blood pressure. adults should do at least 150 minutes (two hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week. examples of moderate intensity activity include cycling or fast walking. for it to count, the activity should make you feel warm and slightly out of breath. someone who is overweight may only have to walk up a slope to get this feeling. physical activity can include anything from sport to walking and gardening.'}, {'weight': ' being overweight forces your heart to work harder to pump blood around your body. this can raise your blood pressure, which in turn puts pressure on your arteries. use a\xa0bmi healthy weight calculator to find out if you need to lose weight. if you need to shed some weight, it’s worth remembering that losing just a few pounds will make a big difference to your blood pressure and overall health. get tips on losing weight safely'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been received'}]"

acne,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/acne/,"[{'about acne': ' acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. it causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that’s hot or painful to touch. acne most commonly develops on the:face – this affects almost everyone with acne back – this affects\xa0more than\xa0half of people with acne chest – this affects\xa0about 15% of\xa0people with acne'}, {'types of spots': ' there are 6\xa0main types of spot caused by acne:blackheads –\xa0small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin;\xa0they’re not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring) whiteheads – have a similar appearance to blackheads, but\xa0may be firmer and won’t empty when squeezed papules –\xa0small red bumps that may feel tender or sore pustules –\xa0similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus nodules –\xa0large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be\xa0painful cysts –\xa0the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they’re large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils\xa0and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring'}, {'what can i do if i have acne?': ' the self-help techniques below may be useful:don’t wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse wash the affected area with\xa0a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. very hot or cold water can make acne worse don’t try to “clean out” blackheads or squeeze spots.\xa0this can make them worse and cause permanent scarring avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin) completely remove make-up before going to bed if dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient regular exercise can’t improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem.\xa0shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne wash your hair regularly\xa0and try to avoid letting\xa0your hair fall across your face although acne can’t be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. several creams, lotions and gels\xa0for treating spots are available at pharmacies. if you develop acne, it’s a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice. treatments can take up to 3\xa0months to work, so don’t expect results overnight. once they do start to work, the results are usually good.'}, {'when to get professional advice': ' acne isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. if your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back,\xa0it may need to be treated with\xa0antibiotics\xa0or stronger creams that are only\xa0available on prescription. your pharmacist can advise on whether you need to see your gp for further treatment. if you develop nodules or cysts, they need to be treated properly through your gp to avoid scarring.\xa0try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring.'}, {'why do i have acne?': ' acne is most commonly\xa0linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age. certain hormones cause\xa0the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). this abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called p. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus. the hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). cleaning the skin doesn’t help to remove this blockage.'}, {'who’s affected?': ' acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. about 80% of people aged 11\xa0to 30\xa0are affected by acne. acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14\xa0to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16\xa0to 19. most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties. in some cases, acne can continue into adult life. about\xa05% of\xa0women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25.'}, {'further information': ' you can find support and information from organisations like:changing faces – a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice'}, {'causes of acne': ' acne is caused when tiny holes in the skin, known as hair follicles, become blocked. sebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of your skin. the glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of. sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. they do this by producing an oily substance called sebum. in acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. the excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle. if the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead. normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts.'}, {'testosterone': ' teenage acne\xa0is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. the hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls. the sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones.\xa0it’s thought that increased levels of\xa0testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs.'}, {'acne in families': ' acne\xa0can run in families. if your parents had acne, it’s likely that you’ll also develop it. one study has found that if both your parents had acne, you’re more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. it also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you’re more likely to get adult acne too.'}, {'acne in women': ' more than\xa080% of\xa0cases of adult acne\xa0occur in women. it’s thought that many cases of adult acne are\xa0caused by\xa0the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times. these times\xa0include:periods\xa0– some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period pregnancy\xa0– many women have symptoms of acne at this time, usually during the first 3\xa0months of their pregnancy polycystic ovary syndrome\xa0–\xa0a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovary'}, {'other triggers': ' other possible triggers of an acne flare-up include:some cosmetic products\xa0–\xa0however, this is less common as most products are now tested,\xa0so they don’t cause spots\xa0(non-comedogenic) certain medications\xa0–\xa0such as steroid medications, lithium\xa0(used to treat\xa0depression and bipolar disorder) and\xa0some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treat\xa0epilepsy) regularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as\xa0a headband or backpack smoking\xa0– which can contribute to acne in older people'}, {'acne myths': ' despite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood.\xa0there are\xa0many myths and misconceptions about it:'}, {'diagnosing acne': ' your pharmacist can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. this involves examining your face and possibly your chest and back for different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules. how many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. this is\xa0important in planning your treatment. 4\xa0grades can be used to measure the severity of acne:grade 1 (mild) – acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules grade 2 (moderate) – there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face grade 3 (moderately severe) – there’s a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne grade 4 (severe) – there’s a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules'}, {'acne in women': ' if acne suddenly starts\xa0in adult women, it\xa0can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, especially if it’s accompanied by other symptoms such as:excessive body hair (hirsutism) irregular or light periods the most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is\xa0polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). pcos can be diagnosed using a combination of\xa0ultrasound scans and blood tests.'}, {'treating acne': ' treatment for acne depends on how severe it is. it can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve. the various treatments for acne are outlined below. if you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide.'}, {'treatments from your gp': ' see your gp if your acne is more widespread,\xa0as you probably need prescription medication.\xa0for example, if:you have a large number of papules and pustules over-the-counter medication hasn’t worked prescription medications that can be used to treat acne include:topical retinoids topical\xa0antibiotics azelaic acid antibiotic tablets in women, the combined oral contraceptive pill isotretinoin tablets if you have severe acne,\xa0your gp can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). for example, if you have:a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face painful nodules a combination of\xa0antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. if this doesn’t work, a medication called\xa0isotretinoin may be prescribed. hormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. however, the\xa0progestogen-only pill or\xa0contraceptive implant can sometimes make acne worse. many of these treatments can take 2\xa0to 3\xa0months before they start to work. it’s important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if\xa0there’s no immediate effect.'}, {'topical treatments (gels, creams and lotions)': ''}, {'antibiotic tablets': ' antibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne. in most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. pregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use. it usually takes about 6\xa0weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne. depending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last 4\xa0to 6\xa0months. tetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and uv light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment. you’ll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, during this time.'}, {'hormonal therapies': ' hormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around\xa0periods or\xa0is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome. if you don’t already use it, your gp may recommend the combined oral contraceptive pill, even if you’re not sexually active. this combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen.'}, {'isotretinoin': ' isotretinoin\xa0has a number of beneficial effects:it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is\xa0produced it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin it reduces redness and swelling in and around spots however,\xa0the drug\xa0can also cause a wide range of side effects. it’s only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven’t responded to other treatments. because of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained gp or a\xa0dermatologist. isotretinoin is taken\xa0as a\xa0tablet. most people take a 4\xa0to 6 month course. your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. however, this is normal and soon settles. common side effects of isotretinoin include:inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils changes in your blood sugar levels inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis) blood in your urine rarer side effects of isotretinoin include:inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) kidney disease because of the risk of these rarer side effects, you’ll need a\xa0blood test before and during treatment.'}, {'non-pharmaceutical treatments': ' several treatments for acne don’t involve medication. these include:comedone extractor – a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads chemical peels – where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it photodynamic therapy – where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne however, these treatments may not work and can’t be routinely recommended.'}, {'complications of acne': ' acne scarring can sometimes develop as a complication of acne. any type of acne spot can lead to scarring, but it’s more common when the most serious types of spots (nodules and cysts) burst and damage nearby skin. scarring\xa0can also occur if you pick or squeeze your spots, so it’s important not to do this. there are 3\xa0main types of acne scars:ice pick scars – small, deep holes in the surface of your skin that look like the skin has been punctured with a sharp object rolling scars – caused by bands of scar tissue that form under the skin, giving the surface of the skin a rolling and uneven appearance boxcar scars – round or oval depressions, or craters, in the skin'}, {'treating acne scarring': ' treatments for acne scarring are regarded as a type of cosmetic surgery, which isn’t usually available on the nhs. however, in the past, exceptions have been made when it’s been shown that acne scarring has caused serious psychological distress. see your gp if you’re considering having cosmetic surgery. they’ll be able to discuss your options with you and advise you about the likelihood of having the procedure carried out on the nhs. many private clinics offer treatment for acne scarring. prices can vary widely (from £500 to\xa0more than\xa0£10,000) depending on the type of treatment needed. the british association of plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgeons website has more information about private treatment available in your area. it’s important to have realistic expectations about what cosmetic treatment can achieve. while treatment can certainly improve the appearance of your scars, it can’t get rid of them completely. after treatment for acne scarring, most people notice a 50-75% improvement in their appearance. some of the available treatments for acne scarring are explained below.'}, {'depression': ' acne can often cause intense feelings of anxiety and stress, which can sometimes make people with the condition become socially withdrawn. this combination of factors can lead to people with acne becoming depressed. you may be depressed if during the last month you’ve often felt down, depressed or hopeless, and have little interest or pleasure in doing things. if you think that you or your child may have depression, it’s important to speak to your gp. treatments for depression include:talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural

acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/acute-lymphoblastic-leukaemia/,"[{'about acute lymphoblastic leukaemia': ' leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. acute leukaemia means the condition progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment. acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. there are 2 main types:lymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections neutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage these pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. the following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:chronic lymphocytic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia acute myeloid leukaemia'}, {'warning signs of acute leukaemia': ' symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\xa0usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases. symptoms\xa0include:pale skin tiredness breathlessness having repeated infections over a short space of time unusual and frequent bleeding read more about the symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia'}, {'what happens in acute leukaemia': ' all of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow – a spongy material found inside bones. bone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells:red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells, which help fight infection platelets, which help stop bleeding the bone marrow usually produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. but in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells. as the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. this drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding. also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection. despite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children. the cause or causes of acute leukaemia are uncertain, but known risk factors include:exposure to high levels of radiation exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettes read more information about the causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia'}, {'symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia': ' symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases. most of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply. symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include:pale skin feeling tired and breathless having repeated infections over a short space of time unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above night sweats bone and joint pain easily bruised skin swollen lymph nodes (glands) abdominal pain – caused by a swollen liver or spleen unexplained weight loss a purple skin rash (purpura) in some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. this can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including:headaches seizures (fits) vomiting blurred vision dizziness'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' if you or your child has some or even all of these symptoms, it is still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause. however, see your gp as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs to be promptly investigated and treated.'}, {'causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia': ' acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by a dna mutation in the stem cells causing too many white blood cells to be produced. the white blood cells\xa0are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature\xa0and able to fight infection like fully developed white blood cells. as the number of immature cells increases,\xa0the number of\xa0healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it’s this\xa0fall\xa0which causes many of the\xa0symptoms of leukaemia. it is not known exactly what causes this dna mutation to occur, but there are\xa0a few\xa0factors which may increase the\xa0risk of\xa0developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.'}, {'risk factors': ''}, {'diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia': ' the first step in diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is for your gp to check for physical signs of the condition, such as swollen glands, and to take a blood sample. a high number of abnormal white blood cells in the blood sample could indicate the presence of acute leukaemia and you will then be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).'}, {'bone marrow biopsy': ' to confirm a diagnosis of acute leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. the haematologist will use a local anaesthetic to numb the skin over a bone – usually the hip bone – and then use a needle to remove a sample of bone marrow. you may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. the procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight. the bone marrow will be checked for cancerous cells and – if found – the type of acute leukaemia will be determined at the same time.'}, {'further tests': ' there are various additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. they can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. these tests are described below.'}, {'treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia': ' treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begins a few days after diagnosis as it’s an aggressive condition that develops rapidly.'}, {'stages of treatment': ' treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is carried out in stages:induction – the aim of the initial stage of treatment is to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood\xa0and resolve any symptoms you may have consolidation – this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system maintenance – the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returning maintenance only seems to be effective in treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; it’s not usually used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia.'}, {'induction': ' the induction stage of treatment is carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre. this is because you will probably need to have regular\xa0blood transfusions as it’s likely that your blood will not contain enough healthy blood cells. you will also be vulnerable to infection, so it is important that you are in a sterile environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection that you have can be promptly treated. you may also be prescribed\xa0antibiotics to help prevent further infection.'}, {'consolidation': ' leukaemia can return if just one cancerous cell remains in your body. therefore the aim of consolidation treatment is to ensure that any remaining leukaemia cells are killed. treatment involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication. this is usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. however, you may require some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection. the consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.'}, {'maintenance': ' the maintenance phase is designed to act as further insurance against the possibility of the leukaemia returning. it involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets while undergoing regular check-ups to monitor how effective your treatment is proving. the maintenance phase can often last for two years.'}, {'other treatments': ' as well as chemotherapy and imatinib, other treatments are used in some circumstances. these are described below.'}, {'complications of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia': ' being immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with acute leukaemia. there are 2 reasons for this:the lack of healthy white blood cells means that your immune system is less able to fight infection many of the medicines used to treat\xa0acute leukaemia\xa0can weaken the immune system this means that\xa0you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications. you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections occurring. you should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your gp or\xa0care team\xa0because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications. symptoms of infection include:high temperature (fever) of 38c (101.4f) or above headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness avoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. this is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be lower. while it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour. also ensure that all of your\xa0vaccinations are up-to-date. your gp or care team will be able to advise you about this. you will be unable to have any vaccine containing activated particles of viruses of bacteria such as:the\xa0mumps, measles and rubella (mmr) vaccine the polio vaccine the oral typhoid vaccine the bcg vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis) the yellow fever vaccine'}, {'bleeding': ' if you have acute leukaemia, you will bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. bleeding may also be excessive when it does occur. bleeding can occur:inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) the symptoms of an intracranial haemorrhage include:severe headache stiff neck vomiting change in mental state, such as confusion the most common symptoms of a pulmonary haemorrhage are:coughing up blood from your nose and mouth breathing difficulties a bluish skin tone (cyanosis) the 2 most common symptoms of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage are:vomiting blood passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like all 3 types of haemorrhages should be regarded as medical emergencies. phone 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you or your child is experiencing a haemorrhage.'}, {'infertility': ' many of the treatments that are used to treat acute leukaemia can cause infertility. infertility is often temporary, although in some cases it may be permanent. people who are particularly at risk of becoming infertile are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. it may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. for example, men can have samples of their sperm stored. similarly, women can have fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb following treatment. read more about\xa0infertility'}, {'psychological effects of leukaemia': ' receiving a diagnosis of leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. at first, the news may be difficult to take in. the situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of stress, anxiety and depression. if you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition. you may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. your gp or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups. another excellent resource is macmillan cancer support. their helpline number is\xa00808 808 00 00\xa0and is open monday to friday, 9am–8pm.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank

the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs. there are 3 main types of blood cells:white blood cells – which help fight infection red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding the bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. to begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature). the main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. they can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells. once blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. they leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed.'}, {'how leukaemia develops': ' in leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets

lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) is chemotherapy. this means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. you’ll also have drugs called steroids, which help the chemotherapy to work. the treatment for all is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. but you’ll be in close contact with the hospital when you’re most likely to feel unwell and the staff will be able to help if things get tough. don’t feel you have to be brave. be honest about how you are feeling with your doctors and nurses. they can give you medicines that can help you feel better. all is treated in\xa03\xa0phases:getting rid of the leukaemia\xa0– remission induction keeping the leukaemia away\xa0– consolidation and delayed intensification therapy keeping the leukaemia away long-term\xa0– continuing or maintenance therapy you usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have all. you’ll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with.\xa0if you’re 18 or younger, you’ll be treated in a specialist principal treatment centre (ptc) for teenagers and young adults (tya).\xa0if you’re 19 or older, you’ll be offered the choice of having treatment at the ptc or another hospital closer to home called a tya designated hospital. you’ll be given chemotherapy as tablets, by injection and into your bloodstream (intravenously). you’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around the spinal cord to make sure the leukaemia cells can’t hide there. this is called central nervous system (cns) therapy. it’s also known as intrathecal therapy. you’ll have a ‘line’ put in to one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous treatment. your nurses and doctors can also use the line to take blood samples for blood tests. there are different kinds of lines. having chemotherapy can be hard. but the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. and you’ll be given medicines to stop you feeling sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections. there will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. you might also feel upset, down or irritable. talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings. being in hospital or coming up to hospital for clinics and treatment can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work, or on things your friends are doing. you could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you. it can also help to talk to any new friends you’ve made who are going through similar experiences to you. we have more information about\xa0chemotherapy that has been written for people of all ages, not just teens and young adults.'}, {'getting rid of the leukaemia (remission induction)': ' the first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. you’ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow. this type of treatment involves:chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells (including cns therapy) steroids to help the chemotherapy work drugs (allopurinol or rasburicase) to help protect your kidneys from problems that can happen when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once another tablet (for example ranitidine or lansoprazole) to stop indigestion or ulcers you need to stay in hospital during this phase of your treatment so the doctors can check how things are going. treatment to get you into remission takes about\xa05 weeks, sometimes a bit longer. being in hospital that long can be really difficult at times. if you’re struggling to cope, try and talk to your friends, family, doctors and nurses. it’s important not to bottle up your feelings otherwise your might end up finding it hard to cope. drugs you may be given include:vincristine asparaginase daunorubicin mercaptopurine methotrexate'}, {'central nervous system therapy': ' chemotherapy given as tablets or into the blood can reach most places in your body. but it isn’t good at getting into the brain or spinal cord (called the central nervous system or cns). so you’ll be given treatment into the fluid that goes around the cns to target any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. this is called cns therapy. cns therapy is given during remission induction treatment (to get rid of the leukaemia) and continues right until the end of maintenance therapy. chemotherapy is given into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or csf, around your spinal cord. drug treatment given into the csf is called intrathecal therapy. it’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. a doctor puts a needle into the space between 2 small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. then they inject chemotherapy into the csf. the csf will carry the chemotherapy around your cns so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there. the chemotherapy drug used for cns therapy is called methotrexate.'}, {'keeping leukaemia away': ' this treatment is called consolidation and delayed intensification therapy. when you’re in remission, it means the doctors can’t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples when they check them under the microscope. but there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so you need further treatment to get rid of these cells. you’ll be given different types of chemotherapy drugs. this is so the leukaemia cells don’t have a chance to get used to them (which is called drug resistance). this phase of treatment takes about 5 to 6 months. most of the treatment can be given as an outpatient but you might need to stay in hospital for some parts of it. drugs you may be given include:cyclophosphamide cytarabine (ara-c) mercaptopurine methotrexate vincristine asparaginase doxorubicin'}, {'keeping the leukaemia away long term (maintenance therapy)': ' this treatment is given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as relapse). the chemotherapy is given in low doses. you have it as an outpatient so you can keep doing all your normal, everyday activities when you’re having maintenance therapy. maintenance therapy is given in 12-week cycles.

acute myeloid leukaemia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/acute-myeloid-leukaemia/,"[{'about acute myeloid leukaemia': ' leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment. acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. the 2 main types of white blood cells are:lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending\xa0the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage this topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (aml), which is an aggressive\xa0cancer of the myeloid cells. the following types of leukaemia are covered separately:acute lymphoblastic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia'}, {'signs and symptoms of aml': ' the\xa0symptoms of aml usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. symptoms can include:pale skin tiredness breathlessness frequent infections unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds in more advanced cases, aml can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding. read more about the complications of aml'}, {'seeking medical advice': ' you should see your gp if you or your child have possible symptoms\xa0of aml. although it’s highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause,\xa0these symptoms should be investigated. if your gp thinks you may have leukaemia, they’ll arrange blood tests to check your blood cell production. if the tests suggest there’s a problem, you’ll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment. read more about diagnosing aml'}, {'what causes aml?': ' aml\xa0occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones),\xa0produce too many immature white blood cells. these immature cells are known as blast cells. blast cells don’t have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can\xa0lead to a\xa0decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot). it’s not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there’s no identifiable cause. however,\xa0a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing aml have been identified. these include:previous\xa0chemotherapy or radiotherapy exposure to very high levels of radiation\xa0(including previous\xa0 radiotherapy\xa0treatment) exposure to benzene – a chemical used in manufacturing that’s also found in cigarette smoke having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as down’s syndrome read more about the causes of aml'}, {'who’s affected': ' aml\xa0is a rare type of cancer.\xa0the risk of developing aml increases with\xa0age. it’s\xa0most common in people over 65.'}, {'how aml is treated': ' aml is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed. chemotherapy\xa0is the main treatment for aml. it’s used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing). in some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a\xa0bone marrow or stem cell transplant, to achieve a cure. read more about treating aml'}, {'symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia': ' the symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) usually develop over a few weeks, becoming more severe as the number of immature white blood cells (blast cells) in your blood increases. symptoms of aml can\xa0include:pale skin tiredness breathlessness a high temperature (fever) excessive sweating weight loss frequent infections unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds easily bruised skin flat\xa0red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae) bone and joint pain a feeling of fullness or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen), caused by swelling of the liver or spleen in\xa0rare cases of aml, the affected cells can spread into the central nervous system. this can cause symptoms such as headaches, fits (seizures), vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness.'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' see your gp if you or your child have these symptoms. although it’s highly unlikely that aml is the cause, these symptoms need to be investigated and treated\xa0promptly.'}, {'causes of acute myeloid leukaemia': ' acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is caused by a dna mutation in the stem cells in your bone marrow that produce red blood cells, platelets and infection-fighting white blood cells. the mutation\xa0causes the stem cells\xa0to produce many more white blood cells that are needed. the white blood cells produced are still immature, so they don’t have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. these immature cells are known as ‘blast cells’. as the number of immature cells increases, the amount of healthy red blood cells and platelets decrease, and it’s this fall that causes many of the symptoms of leukaemia.'}, {'increased risk': ' it’s not known what triggers the genetic mutation\xa0in aml, although a number of different factors that\xa0can increase your risk of developing the condition have been identified. the main risk factors for aml are\xa0outlined below.'}, {'diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia': ' in the initial stages of diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia (aml), your gp will check for physical signs of the condition and arrange for you to have blood tests. a high number of abnormal white blood cells, or a very low blood count in the test sample, could indicate the presence of leukaemia. if this is the case, you’ll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions). a haematologist may carry out further blood tests, in addition to some of the tests outlined on this page.'}, {'bone marrow biopsy': ' to confirm a diagnosis of aml, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. this procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy, which is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic. the haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a thin needle to remove a sample of liquid bone marrow. in some cases, a larger needle may also be used to remove a small amount of bone and bone marrow together. you won’t feel any pain during the procedure, but you may experience some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. the procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete, and you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight. the bone marrow sample will be checked for cancerous cells. if cancerous cells are present, the biopsy can also be used to determine the type of leukaemia you have.'}, {'further tests': ' additional tests can be used to reveal more information about the progress and extent of your aml. they can also provide insight into how the condition should be treated. these tests are described below.'}, {'treating acute myeloid leukaemia': ' acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, so treatment will usually begin a few days after a diagnosis has been confirmed. as aml is a complex condition, it’s usually treated by a multidisciplinary team (mdt) – a group of different specialists working together.'}, {'your treatment plan': ' treatment for aml is often carried out in 2 stages:induction – the aim of this initial stage of treatment is to kill as many leukaemia cells in your blood and bone marrow as possible, restore your blood to proper working order and treat any symptoms you may have consolidation – this stage aims to prevent the cancer returning (relapsing), by killing any remaining leukaemia cells that may be present in your body the induction stage of treatment isn’t always successful and sometimes needs to be repeated before consolidation can begin. if you have a relapse after treatment, both re-induction and consolidation may need to be carried out. this may be the same as your first treatment, although it’s likely to involve different medications or a stem cell transplant. if you’re thought to have a high risk of experiencing complications of aml treatment – for example, if you’re over 75 years of age or have another underlying health condition – less intensive chemotherapy treatment may be carried out. this is less likely to successfully kill all of the cancerous cells in your body, but it can help control your condition.'}, {'induction': ' the initial treatment you have for aml will largely depend on whether you’re fit enough to have intensive\xa0chemotherapy, or whether treatment at a lower dosage is recommended.'}, {'consolidation': ' if induction is successful, the next stage of treatment will be consolidation. this often involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication that are usually given on an outpatient basis, which means that you won’t have to stay in hospital overnight. however, you may need some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection. the consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.'}, {'other treatments': ' many other treatments are used for aml.'}, {'clinical trials and\xa0newer unlicensed treatments': ' in the uk, a number of clinical trials\xa0are currently underway that aim to find the best way of treating aml. clinical trials are studies that use new and experimental techniques to see how well they work in treating, and possibly curing, aml. as part of your treatment, your care team may suggest taking part in a clinical trial to help researchers learn more about the best way to treat your\xa0aml, and aml in general. search for clinical trials for aml. if you take part in a clinical trial, you may be offered medication that isn’t licensed for use in the uk and isn’t normally available. however, there’s no guarantee that the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will work better than current treatments. your care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved.'}, {'complications of acute myeloid leukaemia': ' if you have acute myeloid leukaemia (aml), you may experience a number of complications. these can be caused by the condition itself, although they can also occur as a side effect of treatment.'}, {'weakened immune system': ' having a weakened immune system – being immunocompromised – is a common complication of aml. even if your blood is restored to normal working order with treatment, many of the medications that are used to treat\xa0aml can temporarily weaken your immune system. this means you’re more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you develop could be more serious than usual. complications arising from infection are the leading cause of death in people with aml. however, if treated early, nearly all infections respond to appropriate treatment. therefore, you may be advised to:take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections maintain good personal and dental hygiene avoid contact with anyone who’s\xa0known to have an infection – even if it’s a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as\xa0chickenpox or measles check with your gp to ensure that all of your vaccinations are up to date, although\xa0you won’t be able to have any vaccine that contains ‘live’ viruses or bacteria, such as the\xa0shingles vaccine and mmr vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella) report any possible symptoms of an infection\xa0to your\xa0treatment unit immediately because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent complications. symptoms of an infection can\xa0include:a high temperature (fever) a\xa0headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness'}, {'bleeding': ' if you have aml, you’ll bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. bleeding may also be excessive. people with advanced aml are more\xa0vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body, which is the second most common cause of death in people with the condition. serious bleeding can occur:inside\xa0the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as a\xa0severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting and confusion inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) – causing\xa0symptoms such as coughing up blood,\xa0breathing difficulties and a\xa0bluish skin tone (cyanosis) inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as\xa0vomiting blood and\xa0passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like in colour all these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies. dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring.'}, {'infertility': ' many of the treatments that are used to treat aml can cause infertility.\xa0this is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent. people who are particularly at risk of permanent infertility, are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and\xa0radiotherapy in preparation for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. your treatment team can give a good estimation of the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances. it may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. for example, men can have their sperm samples stored. similarly, women can have eggs or\xa0fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb, following treatment. however, as aml is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, there may not always be time to do this before treatment needs to start.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your

acute myeloid leukaemia: children,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/acute-myeloid-leukaemia-children/,"[{'leukaemia': ' leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. all blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some of the bones in the body. bone marrow contains:red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body platelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding white blood cells, which help to fight infection there are 2 different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). these white blood cells work together to fight infection. normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. in leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature. these immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. as the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. this leads to an increased risk of infection. there are 4 main types of leukaemia:acute lymphoblastic (all) acute myeloid (aml) chronic lymphocytic (cll) chronic myeloid (cml) chronic leukaemias occur mostly in adults. cll is exclusively an adult condition, whereas cml does occur rarely in children and young people. each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment. this page is about acute myeloid leukaemia (aml).'}, {'acute myeloid leukaemia (aml)': ' acute myeloid leukaemia is an overproduction of immature myeloid white blood cells (blast cells). cells that have started to show some of the features of myeloid cells are said to show differentiation. cells that do not show signs of becoming a particular type of white blood cell are known as undifferentiated. there are different sub-types of aml, depending on exactly which type of cell has become leukaemic, the stage of development (maturation) the cells are at, and whether the cells are differentiated. knowing the sub-type of aml is important, as it helps doctors decide on the best treatment. there are several classification systems for the sub-types of aml. the most commonly used system in the uk is the french-american-british (fab) system.'}, {'causes': ' the exact cause of aml is unknown. research into possible causes of this disease is ongoing. children with certain genetic disorders, such as\xa0down’s syndrome\xa0or li-fraumeni syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. brothers and sisters of a child with aml have a slightly increased risk of developing it, although this risk is still small. other non-cancerous conditions, such as aplastic anaemia or the myelodysplastic syndromes (mds), may increase a child’s risk of developing aml. aml, like all types of cancer, is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.'}, {'signs and symptoms': ' as the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells. children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood. sometimes they may suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells. a child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands. at first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.'}, {'how aml is diagnosed': ' a blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of abnormal leukaemia cells. a sample of bone marrow is needed to confirm the diagnosis. the bone marrow sample is also examined to check for any abnormalities in the chromosomes of the leukaemia cells. a test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. a chest x-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. other tests may be necessary, depending on your child’s symptoms. these tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia, and help doctors to decide on the best treatment.'}, {'treatment': ' the aim of treatment for aml is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. chemotherapy is the main treatment for aml. usually a

leukaemia. for information about aml in people of all ages,\xa0read our general\xa0aml section. leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. in leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control. immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. the body needs these cells to:help fight infection (white cells) carry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells) stop\xa0cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)'}, {'symptoms': ' many of the symptoms of aml are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. symptoms can include:looking paler than usual and feeling tired –\xa0because of too few red blood cells (anaemia) bruises or bleeding\xa0– you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal infections\xa0– because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection aches and pains in your bones swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your

increase the risk of aml:some genetic conditions, like down’s syndrome\xa0(a\xa0genetic condition is something you are born with) some non-cancerous conditions of the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes'}, {'if you’re worried about aml': ' if you think you might have any of the symptoms of aml, you should go to your gp. they’ll talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and can arrange\xa0tests or refer you to see a specialist.\xa0remember that the symptoms can be caused by other things, but it’s important to go and get checked if you are worried.'}, {'leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow': ' to understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow. leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. all blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. a type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs. there are\xa03 main types of blood cells:white blood cells –\xa0which help fight infection red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding the bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. to begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature). the main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. they can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells. once blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. they leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed.'}, {'how leukaemia develops': ' in leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made. they build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.'}, {'types of leukaemia': ' leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.

should speak to your gp as soon as possible if you think you have some of the\xa0symptoms of aml. but remember that the symptoms of aml can be caused by other things.'}, {'visiting your gp': ' your gp will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. there can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you’ll need to have a blood test to help diagnose acute myeloid leukaemia (aml). if you have aml, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you’ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital. this specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood disorders.'}, {'at the hospital': ' the haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. they will also arrange for you to have some more tests. these may include:blood tests\xa0– you’ll need more blood tests even if you’ve had some already to\xa0look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help the doctors decide on the best treatment for you; these tests may be called cytogenetics and immunophenotyping bone marrow test\xa0– to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow\xa0and get send samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping

swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest if you have aml, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. these could be blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, or an echocardiogram (which is an ultrasound of the heart). this may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment. waiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them\xa0– what will happen, how you’ll feel and when you’ll get the results\xa0– can help you cope. thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. you could also talk to a cancer

information about aml in people of all ages, read our general aml\xa0section.'}, {'treating aml': ' the main treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is chemotherapy. this means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. you’ll also have drugs called steroids, which help the chemotherapy to work. the treatment for aml is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. but you’ll be in hospital when you’re most likely to feel unwell, and the staff can help if things get tough. don’t feel you have to be brave. be honest about how you’re feeling with your doctors and nurses. they can give you medicines to help you feel better. there are different phases of treatment for aml:getting rid of the leukaemia – remission induction keeping the leukaemia away\xa0– consolidation and delayed intensification therapy central nervous system (cns) therapy (mainly for teenagers under 16) very often, treatment is given as part of a clinical trial or research study, but it will be your decision whether to take part in the trial or not. clinical trials help doctors to keep improving treatment for leukaemia. you usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have aml. you’ll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with.\xa0if you’re 18 or younger, you’ll be treated in a specialist principal treatment centre (ptc) for teenage and young adults (tya).\xa0if you’re 19 or older, you’ll be offered the choice of having treatment at the ptc or another hospital closer to home called a tya designated hospital. most chemotherapy for aml is given into the bloodstream (intravenously). so you’ll have a ‘line’ put into one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous chemotherapy. there are different kinds of lines. you’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around your spinal cord and brain. this is to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. this type of treatment is called central nervous system (cns) therapy. having chemotherapy can be hard, but the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. and you’ll be given medicines to help you feel less sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections. there will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. you might also feel upset, down or irritable. talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings. being in hospital for long periods can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work or on things your friends are doing. you could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you.'}, {'getting rid of the leukaemia (remission induction)': ' the first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. you’ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow. you have chemotherapy over a few days, then you have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. the days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. you’ll usually have\xa04 cycles of chemotherapy overall with\xa02 courses in the induction phase. some people might also need to have a bone marrow transplant. this normally happens after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. you’ll probably need to stay in hospital most of the time that you’re having remission induction. this is so that the doctors can check how things are going.'}, {'keeping the leukaemia away (post-remission treatment)': ' this phase of treatment is sometimes also called consolidation or intensification treatment. it’s given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as a relapse). when you’re in remission, it means the doctors can’t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples under the microscope. but there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so further treatment is needed to get rid of these cells. you start post-remission treatment soon after you complete remission induction. you’ll usually have\xa02 courses of treatment. you might be given the same chemotherapy drugs you’ve had before (perhaps at similar or higher doses) or you might be given different chemotherapy drugs. when your doctors decide what chemotherapy treatment plan to give you, they will take into account:how well your leukaemia responded to the first lot of treatment (remission induction) the results of the tests that were done when you were diagnosed the following drugs may be used to treat you:cytarabine (ara-c) methotrexate'}, {'central nervous system therapy (cns)': ' you usually won’t need this treatment if you’re 16 or over. but if you’re under 16, you’ll probably have it. cns therapy is given to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be in the brain or spinal cord. (the cns or central nervous system is the name for the brain and spinal cord.) cns therapy involves giving chemotherapy into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or csf, around the spinal cord and brain. it’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. a doctor puts a needle into the space between two small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. then they inject chemotherapy into the csf. the csf will carry the chemotherapy around your cns so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there. you’ll have a lumbar puncture before you start treatment to check for leukaemia cells in the csf. if there is no sign of leukaemia cells, you’ll have\xa02 lots of cns therapy,\xa01 after each cycle of remission induction therapy. if there are leukaemia cells in the csf, you’ll have cns therapy twice a week until all traces of leukaemia cells in your csf have gone. you’ll then have\xa02 more lots of cns therapy just to make sure. for cns therapy for aml, you’ll have chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate and cytarabine and a steroid called hydrocortisone.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been received'}]"

for around half of all cases alcohol consumption – which accounts for about a quarter of all cases by reducing your alcohol intake and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can\xa0help to reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis. read more about the\xa0causes of acute pancreatitis\xa0and preventing acute pancreatitis.'}, {'who is affected?': ' acute pancreatitis\xa0is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age. men are more likely to develop alcohol-related pancreatitis, while women are more likely to develop it as a result of gallstones.'}, {'how it’s treated': ' treatment for acute pancreatitis focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed. this\xa0usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), as well as pain relief, nutritional support and oxygen through tubes into your nose. most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days. however, recovery takes longer in severe cases, as complications\xa0that require additional treatment\xa0may develop. read more about\xa0treating acute pancreatitis.'}, {'complications': ' about 4\xa0out of 5\xa0cases of acute pancreatitis improve quickly and\xa0don’t cause any serious further problems. however, 1\xa0in 5\xa0cases are severe and\xa0can result in life-threatening complications, such as\xa0multiple organ failure. in severe cases where\xa0complications develop, there’s a high\xa0risk of\xa0the condition\xa0being fatal. if a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it’s likely to be several weeks or months before they’re well enough to leave hospital. read more about the possible\xa0complications of acute pancreatitis.'}, {'symptoms of acute pancreatitis': ' the main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly. this aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. eating or drinking\xa0may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods. leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain. acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones\xa0usually develops after eating a large meal. if the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6 to 12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol.'}, {'other symptoms': ' other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting diarrhoea indigestion a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes tenderness or swelling of the abdomen (tummy)'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' contact your gp immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. if this isn’t possible,\xa0contact\xa0nhs 24 111 service or your local\xa0out-of-hours service for advice.'}, {'causes of acute pancreatitis': ' most cases of acute pancreatitis are closely linked to gallstones or to alcohol consumption, although the exact cause isn’t always clear.'}, {'gallstones': ' gallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in your gallbladder. they can trigger acute pancreatitis if they move out of the gallbladder and block the opening of the pancreas. the blockage can disrupt some of the enzymes (chemicals) produced by the pancreas. these enzymes are normally used to help digest food in your intestines, but they\xa0can\xa0start to digest the pancreas instead if\xa0the opening is\xa0blocked. however, not everyone with gallstones will develop acute pancreatitis. most gallstones don’t cause any problems.'}, {'alcohol consumption': ' it’s not fully understood how alcohol causes the pancreas to become inflamed. one theory is that it interferes with the normal workings of the pancreas, causing the enzymes to start digesting it. whatever the cause, there is a clear link between alcohol use and acute pancreatitis. a very large study found that people who regularly drank more than 35 units of alcohol\xa0a week were 4\xa0times more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than people who never drank alcohol (35 units is the equivalent\xa0of drinking around 16 cans of strong lager or 4\xa0bottles of wine a week). binge drinking,\xa0which is drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time, is also thought to increase your risk of developing acute pancreatitis.'}, {'other causes': ' less common causes of acute pancreatitis include:accidental damage or injury to the pancreas – for example, during\xa0a procedure\xa0to\xa0remove gallstones or examine the pancreas certain types of medication,\xa0such as some antibiotics or chemotherapy medication – acute pancreatitis can be\xa0an unexpected side effect of these in a small number of people a viral infection – such as mumps\xa0or measles a complication of cystic fibrosis certain rare conditions – including hyperparathyroidism, reye’s syndrome\xa0and kawasaki disease'}, {'severe pancreatitis': ' little is known about why some people develop severe acute pancreatitis. factors thought to increase your risk include:being 70 years of age or over being obese\xa0(a person is considered obese if they have a\xa0body mass index (bmi) of 30 or above) having 2\xa0or more alcoholic drinks a day smoking researchers have also discovered that people with a specific genetic mutation, known as the mcp-1 mutation, are 8\xa0times more likely to develop severe acute pancreatitis than the general population. a genetic mutation is where the instructions (dna) found in all living cells become scrambled, resulting in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics.'}, {'diagnosing acute pancreatitis': ' most cases of acute pancreatitis are diagnosed in hospital because of the risk of serious complications. the doctor in charge of your care will ask you about the history of your symptoms. they may also carry out a physical examination. if you have acute pancreatitis, certain areas of your abdomen will be very tender to touch. a blood test will be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis. this\xa0can detect signs of acute pancreatitis,\xa0such as\xa0a high level of 2\xa0chemicals called lipase and amylase. at first, it can be difficult to tell whether your acute pancreatitis is mild or severe. you’ll be monitored closely for signs of serious problems, such as organ failure. people with mild acute pancreatitis tend to improve within a week and experience either no further problems or problems that resolve within 48 hours. people with severe acute pancreatitis develop persistent serious problems.'}, {'further testing': ' several tests may be used to help determine the severity of your condition and\xa0assess your risk of developing more serious complications. you may have any of the following tests:a computerised tomography (ct) scan – where a series of x-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, 3d image of your pancreas a\xa0magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan – where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body an ultrasound scan – where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) an ercp uses a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. the endoscope will be passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. a special dye that shows up on\xa0x-rays is then injected through the endoscope into your bile and pancreatic ducts. after the dye has been injected, x-rays will be taken. this test can be useful in cases of gallbladder-associated acute pancreatitis, because it can pinpoint exactly where the gallstone is located. in some cases, it may be possible to pass surgical instruments down the endoscope, so the gallstone can be removed.'}, {'treating acute pancreatitis': ' acute pancreatitis is treated in hospital, where you’ll be closely monitored for signs of serious problems and given supportive treatment, such as fluids and oxygen. many people are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days. in severe cases, complications can develop that require specific additional treatment and you’ll need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit (icu). in these cases, recovery\xa0may take much longer, and the condition can be fatal. read about the potential\xa0complications of acute pancreatitis for more information\xa0on severe cases.'}, {'fluids': ' your body can become dehydrated during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids are provided through a tube connected to one of your veins (this is known as intravenous, or iv, fluid). in severe cases of acute pancreatitis, iv fluids can help to prevent a serious problem called hypovolemic shock, which occurs when a drop in your fluid levels lowers the amount of blood in your body.'}, {'nutritional support': ' although the diet of many people with mild acute pancreatitis isn’t restricted, some\xa0people are advised not to\xa0eat. this is because trying to digest solid food could place too much strain on your pancreas. depending on the severity of the condition, you may not be able to eat solid foods\xa0for a few days or longer. if you\xa0need to avoid solid food, a feeding tube may be\xa0used to provide your body with nutrients. this is known as enteral feeding and\xa0often involves using\xa0a tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube).'}, {'oxygen': ' to ensure your vital organs have enough oxygen, it will usually be supplied through tubes into your nose. the tubes can be removed after a few days, once your condition is improving. in severe cases, ventilation equipment may also be used to assist with your breathing.'}, {'painkillers': ' acute pancreatitis often causes severe abdominal (tummy) pain, so strong painkilling medication will probably be required, such as morphine. some of the painkillers used can make you feel very drowsy. if you’re visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don’t be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive.'}, {'treating the underlying cause': ' once\xa0the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need to be treated.'}, {'complications of acute pancreatitis': ' although most people with acute pancreatitis recover without experiencing further problems, severe cases can have serious complications.'}, {'pseudocysts': ' pseudocysts are sacs of fluid that can develop on the surface of the pancreas. they’re a common complication of acute pancreatitis, thought to affect around 1 in 20 people with the condition. pseudocysts usually develop 4 weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis start. in many cases, they don’t cause any symptoms and are only detected during a computerised tomography (ct) scan. however, in some people, pseudocysts can cause bloating, indigestion and a dull abdominal (tummy) pain. if the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for further treatment, as they usually go away on their own. treatment is usually recommended if you’re experiencing symptoms or if\xa0the pseudocysts are large. larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection. pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst by inserting a needle into\xa0it through your skin. this can also be done by carrying out an endoscopy, where\xa0a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.'}, {'infected pancreatic necrosis': ' in around 1\xa0in 3\xa0severe cases of acute pancreatitis,\xa0a serious complication called infected pancreatic necrosis occurs. in infected pancreatic necrosis, high levels of inflammation cause an interruption to the blood supply of your pancreas. without a consistent supply of blood, some of the tissue of your pancreas will die. necrosis is the medical term for the death of tissue. the dead tissue is extremely vulnerable to infection from bacteria. once an infection has occurred, it can quickly spread into the blood (blood poisoning) and cause multiple organ failure. if left untreated, infected pancreatic necrosis is almost always fatal. infected pancreatic necrosis usually develops 2\xa0to 6\xa0weeks after the\xa0symptoms of acute pancreatitis starts. symptoms include increased abdominal pain and a high temperature. the infection\xa0is treated with injections of antibiotics, and the dead tissue needs to be removed to prevent the infection returning. in some cases, it may be possible to drain away the dead tissue using a thin tube called a catheter, which is placed through the skin. alternatively, laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) can be used.\xa0a small cut\xa0is made in your back and an endoscope is inserted to wash away any dead tissue. if laparoscopic surgery\xa0isn’t possible, a cut\xa0can be\xa0made in your abdomen to allow the dead tissue to be removed. infected pancreatic necrosis is a very serious complication. even with the highest standards of medical care, the risk of dying from organ failure is estimated to be around 1\xa0in 5.'}, {'systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs)': ' another common complication of severe acute pancreatitis is systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs). sirs develops in an estimated 1 in 10 severe cases of acute pancreatitis. in sirs, the inflammation affecting the pancreas spreads throughout the body, which can cause one or more organs to fail. it usually develops during the first week after the\xa0symptoms start, with most cases developing on the same day. symptoms of sirs include:a rise in body temperature to above 38c (100.4f) or a fall in body temperature to below 36c (96.8f) a rapid heartbeat of more than 90 beats a minute an unusually fast breathing rate (more than 20 breaths a minute) there’s currently no cure for sirs, so treatment involves trying to support the body’s functions until the inflammation has passed. the outcome depends on how many organs fail. the higher the number of organs affected, the greater the risk of death.'}, {'chronic pancreatitis': ' if you have repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, the damage to your pancreas may lead to chronic pancreatitis. chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition that can have a serious impact on your quality of life.'}, {'preventing acute pancreatitis': ' as acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones or excessive alcohol consumption, a healthy lifestyle can reduce your chances of developing the condition.'}, {'gallstones': ' the most effective way\xa0of preventing\xa0gallstones is eating a healthy, balanced\xa0diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5\xa0portions a day). your diet should also include wholegrains, found in wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice. this helps lower the amount of cholesterol in your body. there is also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones. because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it’s advisable to avoid eating too many fatty foods with a high cholesterol content. foods high in cholesterol include:meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter and lard cakes and biscuits being overweight also increases your chances of developing gallstones, so maintaining a healthy\xa0weight by eating a\xa0balanced diet and taking plenty of regular exercise can also\xa0help reduce your risk of developing\xa0the condition. read more information and advice about exercise,\xa0healthy eating and losing weight.'}, {'alcohol': ' limiting the amount of alcohol you drink can help prevent your pancreas being damaged, and\xa0reduce your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. it can also lower your chances of developing other serious conditions, such as liver cancer. read the pages on\xa0drinking and alcohol\xa0for more information and advice.'}, {'help us

addison’s disease,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/glands/addisons-disease/,"[{'about addison’s disease': ' addison’s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands. the adrenal glands are 2 small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. they produce\xa0essential hormones: cortisol,\xa0aldosterone and adrenaline. in addison’s disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced. about 8,400 people in the uk have addison’s disease. it can affect people of any age. it’s most common between the ages of 30 and 50.\xa0it’s also more common in women than\xa0men. early-stage symptoms of addison’s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as\xa0depression or flu.\xa0you may experience:fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) muscle weakness low mood loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss increased thirst over time, these\xa0problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting,\xa0cramps\xa0and exhaustion. you may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums. although these symptoms aren’t always caused by addison’s disease, you should\xa0see your gp, so they can be investigated. read more about the symptoms of addison’s disease\xa0and diagnosing addison’s disease'}, {'why it happens': ' the condition\xa0is\xa0usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. it’s not clear why this happens, but it’s responsible for 70% to 90% of cases in the uk. other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as\xa0tuberculosis (tb), although this is uncommon in the uk. read more about the causes of addison’s disease'}, {'treating addison’s disease': ' addison’s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. you’ll need to take the medication for the rest of your life. with treatment, symptoms of addison’s disease can largely be controlled. most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and\xa0are able to\xa0live an active life, with few limitations. however,\xa0many people with addison’s disease also find they must learn to manage\xa0bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such as\xa0diabetes or an underactive thyroid. people with addison’s disease must be aware\xa0of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. this\xa0can happen\xa0when the levels of cortisol\xa0in your body fall\xa0significantly due to not taking your medicines, or during another illness. an adrenal crisis is a medical emergency and warning signs include severe nausea, confusion, fever, headache and weakness. if left untreated, it can be fatal. if

drowsiness or tiredness) muscle weakness low mood (mild depression) or irritability loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss the need to urinate frequently increased thirst craving for salty foods dehydration\xa0can also be an early sign of addison’s disease. it’s caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water.'}, {'later symptoms': ' further\xa0symptoms of addison’s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. however,\xa0additional stress, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse. you may go on to develop:low blood pressure\xa0when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea abdominal,\xa0joint or back pain muscle cramps chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression brownish discolouration of the skin, lips\xa0and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees a\xa0reduced libido (lack of interest in sex), particularly in women some women may also have irregular periods\xa0or miss some periods completely.\xa0children with addison’s disease may experience puberty\xa0later than usual. some people with addison’s disease also develop low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). this can cause

diagnose or rule out the condition.\xa0these symptoms\xa0will usually improve with\xa0appropriate treatment. read more about\xa0diagnosing addison’s disease and treating addison’s disease'}, {'adrenal crisis': ' if addison’s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland\xa0gradually decrease in the body. this causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation\xa0called\xa0an adrenal or addisonian crisis. during an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of addison’s disease appear quickly and\xa0severely. this could happen when\xa0you’re already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all. signs of an adrenal crisis include:severe dehydration pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow

fatal. if you think you or someone you know\xa0with addison’s disease\xa0is having an adrenal crisis, phone 999 for an ambulance. if an adrenal crisis isn’t treated, it can lead to a\xa0coma and death. there’s also a risk your brain won’t get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which\xa0can cause permanent disability.'}, {'causes of addison’s disease': ' addison’s disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces.'}, {'problems with the immune system': ' in the uk, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of addison’s disease, accounting for 70% to 90% of cases. the\xa0immune system is your body’s defence against infection and disease. if you’re ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). these antibodies attack the cause of the illness. however, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. this is known as an autoimmune disorder. addison’s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. when 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won’t be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. once levels of these start decreasing, you’ll experience symptoms of addison’s disease. it’s not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families.'}, {'genetics': ' research has shown that some people with\xa0certain genes\xa0are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders. it’s not clear how these genes lead to addison’s disease\xa0and\xa0similar conditions, but it does mean\xa0your risk of developing addison’s disease is increased if you or a\xa0close family member\xa0have another autoimmune condition, such as:vitiligo – a chronic (long-term) condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin type 1 diabetes – a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)'}, {'other causes': ' tuberculosis (tb)\xa0is the most common cause of addison’s disease worldwide, but is rare in the uk. tb is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body.\xa0it can cause addison’s disease if it damages your adrenal glands. other possible causes of addison’s disease include:infections – such as those linked to aids, or fungal infections a haemorrhage – very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with meningitis\xa0or other types of severe sepsis cancer – if\xa0cancer cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands amyloidosis – a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them surgical removal of\xa0both adrenal glands

often\xa0affects young boys certain treatments needed for cushing’s syndrome – a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the body'}, {'diagnosing addison’s disease': ' to help diagnose addison’s disease, your gp will first ask about your symptoms and review your medical history. they’re also likely to ask if anyone in your family has\xa0an autoimmune disorder (a condition caused by a problem with their immune system). your gp will examine your skin for any evidence of brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation), particularly in certain areas, such as:where skin creases on your palm in your elbow crease on any scars your lips and gums however, hyperpigmentation doesn’t occur in all cases of addison’s disease. you’ll also be tested for\xa0low blood pressure (hypotension) while you’re lying down and again shortly after you stand up. this is to see whether you have postural or orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when you change position).'}, {'blood tests': ' if addison’s disease is suspected,\xa0blood tests will be carried out to measure the levels of\xa0sodium, potassium and cortisol\xa0in your body. a low sodium, high potassium or low cortisol level may indicate\xa0addison’s disease. you may need to see a hospital hormone specialist (endocrinologist) for your blood\xa0to be tested for the following:a low level of the hormone aldosterone a high level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth) a low level of glucose (sugar used for energy) positive adrenal antibodies (antibodies designed to attack the adrenal gland) any of these could be a sign of addison’s disease.'}, {'synacthen stimulation test': ' if cortisol\xa0in your blood\xa0is\xa0low, or your symptoms strongly suggest addison’s disease, you’ll need to have a synacthen stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis. your gp may refer you to an endocrinology unit (a unit that specialises in the study of hormones) for the test. how urgently you’re referred depends on how severe your symptoms are. synacthen is a man-made (synthetic) copy of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth). acth is naturally produced by the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland below the brain) to encourage the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. when synacthen is administered, the adrenal glands should respond in the same way as they would to acth, and release cortisol and\xa0other steroid hormones\xa0into the blood. a blood sample will be taken and tested for cortisol, before an injection of\xa0synacthen is given into your arm. after 30 and 60 minutes, a further\xa0blood sample will be taken for cortisol measurement. if the acth level is high, but the cortisol and aldosterone levels are low, it’s usually confirmation of addison’s disease.'}, {'thyroid function test': ' as well as a synacthen stimulation test, your thyroid gland may also be tested to see if it’s working properly. your thyroid gland is found in your neck. it produces hormones that control your body’s growth and metabolism. people with addison’s disease often have an\xa0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. by testing the levels of certain hormones in your blood, your endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone conditions) can determine whether you have hypothyroidism.'}, {'scans': ' in some cases, your\xa0specialist may refer you for a scan of your adrenal glands. this could be a\xa0computerised tomography (ct) scan or a\xa0magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan.'}, {'diagnosis during an adrenal crisis': ' if addison’s disease is left untreated, it eventually leads to an adrenal crisis. this is where\xa0the\xa0symptoms of addison’s disease appear quickly and severely. during an adrenal crisis, there’s not enough time to perform a synacthen stimulation test to confirm addison’s disease. if possible, blood will be taken and tested for any of the abnormalities listed above. while you’re waiting for the results, treatment may be started with steroid injections, and fluids containing salt and glucose. read more about treating\xa0addison’s disease'}, {'driving': ' if you’re diagnosed with addison’s disease and\xa0have a bus, coach or lorry licence, it’s your legal obligation to inform the driver and vehicle licensing agency (dvla). read\xa0about\xa0driving and\xa0addison’s disease\xa0on the gov.uk website.'}, {'treating addison’s disease': ' if you have addison’s disease, you’ll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. this should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue. in\xa0some cases, the underlying causes of addison’s disease can be treated. for example,\xa0tuberculosis (tb) is treated with a course of\xa0antibiotics over a period of at least 6 months. however, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can’t be cured.'}, {'medication for\xa0addison’s disease': ' treatment usually involves\xa0corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life. corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that\xa0your body no longer produces.\xa0it’s usually taken in tablet form 2 or 3 times a day. in most cases, a medication called\xa0hydrocortisone\xa0is used to replace the cortisol. other possible medicines are\xa0prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used. aldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. your gp may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you’re taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this\xa0may not be necessary.\xa0unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it. in general, the medications used for addison’s disease don’t have side effects, unless your dose is too high. if you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there’s a risk of problems such as weakened bones (osteoporosis), mood swings and difficulty sleeping (insomnia).'}, {'living with addison’s disease': ' many people with addison’s disease find\xa0that taking their medication enables them to continue\xa0with their\xa0normal diet and exercise routines. however, bouts of fatigue are also common, and it can\xa0take some time to learn how to manage these periods of low energy. some people find that needing to take regular doses of medication is restrictive and affects their daily life or emotional health.\xa0missing a dose of medication, or taking it late,\xa0can also lead to exhaustion or insomnia. some people can develop associated health conditions, such as\xa0diabetes or an underactive thyroid, which require extra treatment and management. you’ll usually need to have appointments with an endocrinologist every 6 to 12 months, so they can review your progress and adjust your medication dose, if necessary.\xa0your gp can provide support and repeat prescriptions in between these visits. failing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so\xa0you must:remember to collect your repeat prescriptions keep spare medication as necessary – for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you take your medication every day at the right time pack extra medication if you are going away – usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below) carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary you could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one.'}, {'adjusting your medication': ' at certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. for example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following:an illness or infection – particularly if you have a high temperature of 37.5c (99.5f) an accident, such as a car crash an operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy) you’re taking part in strenuous exercise\xa0not usually part of your daily life this will help your body cope with the additional stress. your endocrinologist will monitor your dosage and advise about any changes. over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. however, always consult your gp or specialist if you’re unsure.'}, {'emergency treatment': ' you and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency. this could be necessary if you go into shock\xa0after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. this may occur if you’re pregnant and have morning sickness. your\xa0endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary. if you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone,

alcohol-related liver disease (arld) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. there are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms. arld\xa0doesn’t usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. when this happens, symptoms can include:feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) swelling in the ankles\xa0and tummy confusion\xa0or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools this means arld is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. if you\xa0regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your gp so they can check if your liver is damaged. read more about:symptoms of arld diagnosing arld'}, {'alcohol and the liver': ' with the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body.\xa0its functions include:filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease the liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. the liver can develop new cells, but prolonged\xa0alcohol misuse\xa0(drinking too much)\xa0over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. this can\xa0result in serious and\xa0permanent damage to your liver. arld is\xa0very

' drinking a large amount\xa0of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. this is\xa0called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of arld. fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it’s an important warning sign that you’re drinking at a harmful level. fatty liver disease is reversible. if you stop drinking alcohol for 2\xa0weeks, your liver should return to normal.'}, {'alcoholic hepatitis': ' alcoholic\xa0hepatitis\xa0– which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis\xa0–\xa0is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. when this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they’re damaging their liver through alcohol. less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking). the liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious\xa0and life-threatening illness. many people die from the condition each year in the uk, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.'}, {'cirrhosis': ' cirrhosis\xa0is a stage of\xa0arld where the liver has become significantly scarred.\xa0even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. it’s generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. a person who has\xa0alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn’t stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5\xa0more years.'}, {'how arld is treated': ' there’s currently no specific medical treatment for arld. the main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. this reduces the risk of\xa0further damage to your liver and\xa0gives\xa0it the best chance of recovering. if\xa0a person is\xa0dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. however, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol\xa0support services. a\xa0liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn’t improve when you stop drinking alcohol. you’ll only be considered for a liver transplant if you’ve developed complications

you have none of these symptoms. read about alcohol misuse (drinking too much). contact your gp for advice\xa0if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse. a good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the cage test, which consists of 4\xa0questions:have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking? have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking? have you ever felt guilty about your drinking? have you ever drunk an ‘eye-opener’, which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves? if you answer yes to 1\xa0or more of the questions, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your gp. see your gp as soon as possible\xa0if you have symptoms of advanced arld. read more about how arld is diagnosed.'}, {'causes of alcohol-related liver disease': ' alcohol-related liver disease (arld) is caused by drinking too much alcohol. the more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing arld. there are 2\xa0ways alcohol misuse\xa0(drinking too much)\xa0can cause arld. these are:drinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time (binge drinking) can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause\xa0hepatitis and cirrhosis, the more serious types of arld evidence suggests people who\xa0regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing arld. read more about alcohol units and how to calculate them.'}, {'additional factors': ' as well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing arld. these\xa0include:being overweight

dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in families'}, {'diagnosing alcohol-related liver disease': ' alcohol-related liver disease (arld) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver. this is because\xa0the condition\xa0causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages. if a doctor suspects arld, they’ll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. they may also ask about your alcohol consumption. it’s important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol to avoid further unnecessary testing. this could lead to a delay in the treatment you need.'}, {'blood tests': ' blood tests\xa0used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. however, liver function tests can be normal\xa0at many stages of liver disease. blood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. a low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn’t functioning properly. a blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage. lab tests online has more information on\xa0liver function tests.'}, {'further testing': ' if your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of arld – either\xa0alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis – you may need further tests.'}, {'imaging tests': ' scans may be needed to\xa0produce detailed images of your liver. this may include:an ultrasound scan a computerised tomography (ct) scan a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan some scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred.'}, {'liver biopsy': ' during a liver\xa0biopsy,\xa0a\xa0fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). a small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope. the\xa0biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. specialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage.'}, {'endoscopy': ' an endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end.\xa0during an endoscopy,\xa0the instrument is\xa0passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach. pictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. the doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis.'}, {'treating alcohol-related liver disease': ' successful treatment for alcohol-related liver disease (arld) often depends on whether someone is willing to stop drinking alcohol and make changes to their lifestyle.'}, {'stopping drinking\xa0alcohol': ' treatment for\xa0arld involves stopping drinking alcohol. this is known as abstinence, which can be vital, depending on what stage the condition is at. if you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least 2\xa0weeks. after this point, it’s usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the\xa0nhs guidelines on alcohol consumption. if you have a more serious form of arld – alcoholic hepatitis\xa0or cirrhosis – life-long abstinence is recommended.\xa0this is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease. stopping drinking isn’t easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with arld have an alcohol dependency problem. nevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and don’t stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure.'}, {'withdrawal symptoms': ' if you’re abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. these will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. this usually takes 3\xa0to 7\xa0days from the time of your last drink. many people initially experience\xa0disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but\xa0in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month. in some cases,\xa0you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. you may also be offered\xa0a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), to help you through the withdrawal process. some people\xa0need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so\xa0their\xa0progress can be closely monitored. if you’re\xa0staying at home, you’ll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. you might see them at home, at your gp surgery or at a specialist nhs service.'}, {'preventing relapses': ' once you’ve stopped\xa0drinking, you may\xa0need further\xa0treatment to help ensure you don’t\xa0start drinking again. the first treatment usually offered\xa0is psychological therapy. this involves\xa0seeing a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing. if psychological therapy alone isn’t effective, you may also need medication to help you abstain from alcohol, such as:acamprosate naltrexone disulfiram read our page on\xa0treating alcohol misuse\xa0for\xa0more information on the treatments offered.'}, {'self-help groups': ' many people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. one of the most well-known is alcoholics anonymous, but there are\xa0many other groups that can help. read the alcohol support\xa0page for more information about the help available.'}, {'diet and nutrition': ' malnutrition\xa0is common in people with arld, so it’s important to eat a\xa0balanced diet to help ensure you get all the nutrients you need. avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid. the damage to your liver can also mean it’s unable to store glycogen – a\xa0carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. when this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet. healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. it may also be helpful to eat 3\xa0or 4\xa0small meals a day, rather than 1\xa0or 2\xa0large meals. your gp can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian. in the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube\xa0inserted through the nose and into the stomach.'}, {'medication\xa0for\xa0symptoms': ' the use of medication to directly\xa0treat\xa0arld is controversial. many experts have argued\xa0there’s limited evidence for its effectiveness. for people with severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment in hospital may be necessary. specific treatment with\xa0corticosteroids\xa0or pentoxifylline medication may be used to reduce inflammation of the liver in some people with this condition. nutritional support is also an important part of treatment in these cases. other medications that have been used to treat liver damage include:anabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication) ropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treat overactive thyroid glands) however, there’s a lack of good evidence that these help and they’re no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis.'}, {'liver transplants': ' in the most serious cases of arld, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to\xa0liver failure. a\xa0liver transplant\xa0is currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure. a liver transplant may be considered if:you develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol you’re otherwise well enough to survive such an operation you commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your life'}, {'complications of alcohol-related liver disease': ' a number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (arld).'}, {'portal hypertension and varices': ' portal hypertension is a common complication of\xa0cirrhosis and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis.\xa0it occurs when\xa0the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level. when the liver becomes severely scarred, it’s harder for blood to move through it. this leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines. the blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. it does this by opening up new blood vessels, usually along the lining of your stomach or oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). these new blood vessels are known as varices. if the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the\xa0walls\xa0of the varices\xa0to split and bleed. this can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead to\xa0anaemia. alternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like. split varices can be treated by using an\xa0endoscope to locate the varices. a tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices.'}, {'ascites': ' a person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around\xa0the intestines. this fluid is known as ascites. initially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). if the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained. this is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin under local anaesthetic. one of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). this is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death.'}, {'hepatic encephalopathy': ' one of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood. if\xa0the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the\xa0blood increase. a high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy. symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include:agitation confusion disorientation muscle stiffness muscle tremors difficulty speaking in very serious cases, a\xa0coma hepatic encephalopathy\xa0may require hospital admission. in hospital, body functions are supported and medication is used to remove toxins from the blood.'}, {'liver cancer': ' liver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developing\xa0liver cancer. over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the uk have risen sharply due to increased levels of alcohol misuse. it’s estimated that, every year, 3-5% of people with\xa0cirrhosis will develop liver cancer.'}, {'help us improve

ankylosing spondylitis?': ' in as, various areas of the spine and other joints become inflamed. as well as causing\xa0pain, stiffness and swelling, this inflammation can damage affected areas of the body over time, and in some cases can lead to\xa0some of the individual bones of the spine fusing (joining together). this fusing of the spine is known as ankylosis. it is not known what causes the

caused by the condition. however, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help prevent or delay its progression. in most cases, treatment will involve a combination of:exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness physiotherapy – where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility medication to help

people in the general population have the hla-b27 gene, but most do not have as. it is thought that having this gene may make you more vulnerable to developing as, and the condition is triggered by one or more environmental factors – although it is not known what these are. testing for this gene may be carried out if as is suspected. however, this test\xa0is not a very reliable method of

ankylosing spondylitis': ' although scans can sometimes show spinal inflammation and fusing of the spine (ankylosis), damage to the spine cannot always be picked up in the early stages of as. this is why\xa0diagnosis is often difficult. in many cases, confirming a diagnosis is a long process that can take years. a diagnosis of as can\xa0usually\xa0be confirmed if an x-ray shows sacroiliitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joints) and you have at least one of the following:at least three months of lower back pain that gets better with exercise and doesn’t improve with rest limited movement in your lumbar spine (lower back) limited chest expansion compared to what is expected for your age and sex if you have all three of these features but do not have sacroiliitis – or if you

available to help relieve the symptoms. treatment can also help delay or prevent the process of the spine fusing (joining up) and stiffening. in most cases, treatment will involve a combination of exercise, physiotherapy and medication, which are described below.'}, {'physiotherapy and exercise': ' keeping active can improve your posture and range of spinal movement, along with preventing your spine from becoming stiff and painful. as well as keeping active, physiotherapy is a key part of treating as. a physiotherapist (a healthcare professional trained in using physical methods of treatment) can advise about the most effective exercises and draw up an exercise programme that suits you. types of physiotherapy recommended for as include:a group exercise programme – where you exercise with others an individual exercise programme – you are given exercises to do by yourself massage – your muscles and other soft tissues are manipulated to relieve pain and improve movement (the bones of the spine should never be manipulated as this can cause injury in people with as) hydrotherapy – exercise in water (usually a warm, shallow swimming pool or a special hydrotherapy bath); the\xa0buoyancy of\xa0the water helps make movement easier\xa0by supporting you, and the warmth can relax your muscles some people prefer to swim or play sport to keep flexible. this is usually fine, although some daily stretching and exercise is also important. if you’re ever in doubt, speak to your physiotherapist or rheumatologist before taking up a new form of sport or exercise. the national ankylosing spondylitis society (nass) provides detailed information about different types of exercise to help you manage your condition.'}, {'painkillers': ' you may need painkillers to manage your condition while you are being referred to a rheumatologist. the rheumatologist may continue prescribing painkillers, although not everyone needs them all the time.'}, {'anti-tnf medication': ' if your symptoms cannot be controlled using painkillers or exercising and stretching, anti-tnf (tumour necrosis factor) medication may be recommended. tnf is a chemical produced by cells when tissue is inflamed. anti-tnf medications are given by injection and work by preventing the effects of tnf, as well as reducing inflammation in your joints caused by ankylosing spondylitis. examples of anti-tnf medication include adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab. these are relatively new treatments for as, and their long-term effects are unknown. however, they have been used for longer in people with\xa0rheumatoid arthritis,\xa0and this is providing clearer information about their long-term safety. if your rheumatologist recommends using anti-tnf medication, the decision about whether they are right for you must be discussed carefully and your progress will be closely monitored. this is because anti-tnf medication can interfere with the immune system (the body’s natural defence system), increasing your risk of developing potentially serious infections.'}, {'corticosteroids': ' corticosteroids have a powerful anti-inflammatory effect and can be taken as tablets or injections by people with as. if a particular joint is inflamed, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the joint. after the injection, you will need to rest the joint for up to 48 hours. it is usually considered wise to have a corticosteroid injection up to three times in one year, with at least three months between injections in the same joint. this is because corticosteroids injections can cause a number of side effects, such as:infection in response to the injection the skin around the injection may change colour (depigmentation) the surrounding tissue may waste away a tendon (cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) near the joint may rupture (burst) corticosteroids may also calm down painful swollen joints when taken as tablets.'}, {'disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards)': ' disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) are an alternative type of medication often used to treat other types of arthritis. dmards may be prescribed for as, although they are only beneficial in treating pain and inflammation in joints in areas of the body other than the spine. two dmards sometimes used to treat inflammation of joints other than the spine include sulfasalazine and methotrexate.'}, {'surgery': ' most people with as will not need surgery. however, in cases where a joint has become severely damaged,\xa0joint replacement surgery may be recommended to improve pain and movement in the affect joint. for example, if the\xa0hip joints are affected, a\xa0hip replacement may be carried out. in rare cases, corrective surgery may be needed\xa0if the spine becomes badly bent.'}, {'follow-up': ' as the symptoms of\xa0as develop slowly and tend to come and go, you will need to see your rheumatologist or gp for regular check-ups. they will make sure your treatment is working properly and may carry out physical assessments to assess how your condition is progressing. this may involve further sets of the same blood tests or x-rays you had at the time of your diagnosis. any complications of ankylosing spondylitis that arise will be treated as they develop.'}, {'complications of ankylosing spondylitis': ' ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a complex condition that can affect many parts of your body. it can cause complications in your day-to-day life and lead to additional health conditions. some complications associated with as are outlined below.'}, {'reduced flexibility': ' although most people with as remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term, around\xa04 in every 10 people with the condition will eventually have severely restricted movement in their spine. this usually only affects the lower back and is\xa0the result of the bones in the spine fusing (joining up). fusing of the spine can make it difficult to move your back and can mean your\xa0posture becomes fixed in one position,\xa0although it doesn’t\xa0lead to severe disability in most cases. in rare cases, surgery may be recommended to correct severe bends in the spine.'}, {'joint damage': ' as can cause joints such as the hips and knees to become inflamed.\xa0this can damage\xa0the affected joints over time, making them painful and difficult to move. if a joint becomes particularly damaged, you may need surgery to replace it with an artificial one.'}, {'iritis': ' iritis, also known as anterior uveitis, is a condition sometimes associated with as where the front part of the eye becomes red and swollen. it usually only affects one eye, rather than both. if you have iritis, your eye may become red, painful and sensitive to light (photophobia). your vision may also become blurred or cloudy. you should visit your gp as soon as possible if you have as and think you may have developed iritis, as the condition can cause the loss of some or all of your vision if not treated promptly. if your gp thinks you have iritis, they will refer you urgently to an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specialises in eye problems) for treatment. iritis can

the appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5 to 10cm (2 to 4 inches) long. it’s connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed. nobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn’t harmful. appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe. pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. you may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience

of appendicitis'}, {'how appendicitis is treated': ' in most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible. removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the uk and its success rate is excellent. the operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted. open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult. most people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6\xa0weeks after open surgery. read more\xa0about treating appendicitis.'}, {'what causes appendicitis?': ' it’s not exactly clear what the causes of appendicitis are. most cases are thought to occur when something\xa0blocks the entrance of the appendix. for example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of\xa0faeces or an upper\xa0respiratory tract infection\xa0could lead to\xa0a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel. this obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. the pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting. as the causes aren’t fully understood, there’s no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis.'}, {'who’s affected?': ' appendicitis is a common condition. it’s estimated around\xa01 in every 13 people develop it at

an ectopic pregnancy or menstrual pain. however, any condition that causes constant stomach pain requires urgent medical attention. you should phone 999 for an ambulance if you get a pain that

present in about half of all cases. also, some people’s appendixes may be located in a slightly different part of their body, such as:the pelvis behind the large intestine around the small bowel near the right lower part of the liver some people develop pain similar to appendicitis, but it’s caused by something else, such as:gastroenteritis severe\xa0irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) constipation a bladder or\xa0urine infection your gp will ask about your symptoms, examine your abdomen, and see if the pain gets worse when pressure is applied to the appendix area (your lower right-hand side). if your symptoms are typical of appendicitis, this is normally enough for your gp to make a confident diagnosis. in\xa0this case, you’ll immediately be referred to hospital for treatment.'}, {'further tests': ' if your symptoms aren’t typical, further tests may be required in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. further tests may involve:a\xa0blood test to look for signs of infection a pregnancy test\xa0for women a urine test to rule out other conditions, such as a bladder infection an ultrasound scan\xa0to see if the appendix is swollen a\xa0computerised tomography (ct) scan it can sometimes take\xa0time to get test results. your surgeon may recommend a laparoscopy to inspect your appendix and pelvic organs if the diagnosis is still uncertain. you’ll usually\xa0be advised to have your appendix removed if appendicitis is suspected, rather than run the risk of it bursting. this means some people will have their appendix removed even though it’s eventually found to be normal. in some cases where a diagnosis is not certain, a doctor may recommend waiting up to 24 hours to see if your symptoms improve, stay the same, or get worse. if your

appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. this operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy. surgery is usually\xa0also recommended if there’s a chance you have appendicitis but it’s not been possible to make a clear diagnosis. this is because it’s considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting. in humans, the appendix doesn’t perform any important function and having it removed doesn’t cause any long-term problems.'}, {'the procedure': ' appendectomies are carried out under\xa0general anaesthetic using either a keyhole or open technique.'}, {'recovery': ' one of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation. if the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. with open or complicated surgery\xa0– for example, if you have peritonitis\xa0– it may\xa0take up to\xa0a week before you’re well enough to go home. for the first few days after the operation you’re likely to experience some pain and bruising. this improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary. if you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. this is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation. you may also experience some short-term constipation. you can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and\xa0staying well hydrated. your gp can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome. before leaving hospital, you’ll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid. in most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for 4\xa0to 6\xa0weeks after open surgery.'}, {'risks': ' appendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the uk, and serious or long-term complications are rare. however, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. these include:antibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections bleeding under the skin that causes a firm swelling (haematoma) – this usually gets better on its own, but you should see your gp if you’re concerned scarring – both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made a collection of pus (abscess) – in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery hernia – at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approach the use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading to pneumonia. however, serious complications like this are very rare.'}, {'alternatives to emergency surgery': ' in some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass. this lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself. if an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it’s not necessary to operate immediately. instead, you’ll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled. another possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis. however, studies have looked into whether antibiotics could be an alternative to surgery and as yet there isn’t enough clear evidence to suggest this is the case.'}, {'complications of appendicitis': ' if appendicitis isn’t treated, the appendix can burst and cause potentially life-threatening infections. phone 999 for an ambulance if you have abdominal (tummy) pain that suddenly gets much worse and spreads across your abdomen. these are signs your appendix may have burst.'}, {'peritonitis': ' if your appendix bursts, it releases bacteria into other parts of the body. this can cause a condition called peritonitis if the infection spreads to the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen. symptoms of peritonitis can include:severe continuous abdominal pain feeling sick or being sick a high temperature (fever) a rapid heartbeat shortness of breath\xa0with rapid breathing swelling of the abdomen if peritonitis isn’t treated immediately, it can cause long-term problems and may even be fatal. treatment for peritonitis usually involves antibiotics and the surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy).'}, {'abscesses': ' sometimes an\xa0abscess forms around a burst appendix. this is a painful collection of pus that occurs as a result of the body’s attempt to fight the infection. it can also occur as a complication of surgery to remove the appendix in about 1 in 500 cases. abscesses can sometimes be treated using antibiotics, but in the vast majority of cases the pus needs to be drained from the abscess. this can be carried out under ultrasound or computerised tomography (ct) guidance using local anaesthetic and a needle inserted through the skin, followed by the\xa0placement of a drain. if an abscess is found during surgery, the area is carefully washed

is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. the face is more commonly involved in adults. the severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. people with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. in more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching. scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. it can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. this can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work. areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. this is more noticeable in people with darker skin. it’s not\xa0a result of\xa0scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a “footprint” of old

likelihood of developing atopic eczema because of the genes you inherit from your parents. research has shown children who have 1\xa0or both parents with atopic eczema, or who have other siblings with eczema, are more likely to develop it themselves. atopic eczema is not infectious, so it cannot be passed on through close contact.'}, {'eczema triggers': ' there are a number of things that may

worse. you may be asked about your diet and lifestyle to see if something obvious may be contributing to your symptoms. for example, you may have noticed some soaps or shampoos make the eczema worse. you may also be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse. a food diary involves writing down everything you eat and making a record of any eczema flare-ups you have. your pharmacist can then use the diary to see if there is a pattern between your symptoms and what you eat. allergy tests\xa0are not usually needed to identify triggers,

causes of atopic eczema.'}, {'treating atopic eczema': ' there is no cure for atopic eczema, but treatments can ease the symptoms. many children find their symptoms naturally improve as they get older. the main treatments for atopic eczema are:emollients\xa0(moisturisers) – used every day to stop the skin becoming dry topical corticosteroids–\xa0creams and ointments used to reduce swelling and redness during flare-ups other treatments include topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus for eczema in sensitive sites not responding to simpler treatment,\xa0antihistamines for severe itching,

your skin is sore and inflamed, your pharmacist may recommend a topical corticosteroid (applied directly to your skin), which can reduce the inflammation within a few days. topical corticosteroids can be prescribed in different strengths, depending on the severity of your atopic eczema and the areas of skin affected. they can be very mild (such as hydrocortisone), moderate (such as clobetasone butyrate), or even stronger (such as mometasone). if you need to use corticosteroids frequently, see your gp regularly so they can check the treatment is working effectively and you are using the right amount.'}, {'antihistamines': ' antihistamines are a type of medicine that blocks the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. they\xa0can help relieve the itching associated with atopic eczema. they can either\xa0be sedating, which cause drowsiness,\xa0or\xa0non-sedating. if you have severe itching, your pharmacist may suggest trying\xa0a non-sedating antihistamine. if itching during a flare-up affects your sleep, your pharmacist may suggest taking a sedating\xa0antihistamine. sedating\xa0antihistamines can cause drowsiness into the following day, so it may be helpful to let your child’s school know they may not be as alert as normal.'}, {'bandages and wet wraps': ' in some cases, your gp may prescribe special medicated bandages, clothing or wet wraps to wear over areas of skin affected by eczema. these can either be used over emollients or with topical corticosteroids to prevent scratching, allow the skin underneath to heal, and stop the skin drying out.'}, {'corticosteroid tablets': ' corticosteroid tablets\xa0are rarely used to treat atopic eczema nowadays, but may occasionally be prescribed for short periods of 5\xa0to 7\xa0days to help bring particularly severe flare-ups under control. longer courses of treatment are generally avoided because of the risk of potentially serious side effects. if your gp thinks your condition may be severe enough to benefit from repeated or prolonged treatment with corticosteroid tablets, they will probably refer you to a specialist.'}, {'seeing a specialist': ' in some cases, your gp may refer you to a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). you may be referred if your gp is not sure what type of eczema you have, normal treatment is not your eczema, your eczema is affecting your

enlargement (bpe), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph), is a condition that affects older men and anyone with a prostate. it’s particularly common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age and isn’t usually a serious threat to health.'}, {'prostate gland': ' the prostate is a small gland, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder. it’s involved in the production of semen. the prostate produces a thick, white fluid that’s made into a thinner\xa0liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (psa). the liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen. if the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). this can\xa0affect how you pass urine and may cause:difficulty starting urination a frequent need to urinate difficulty fully emptying the bladder in some men and anyone with a prostate, the symptoms are mild and don’t require treatment. in others, the symptoms can be very troublesome and have a major impact on a person’s quality of life. read more about the\xa0symptoms of benign prostate enlargement many people worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.\xa0this isn’t the case. the risk of prostate cancer is no greater for people with an enlarged prostate than it is for those without an\xa0enlarged prostate.'}, {'what causes benign prostate enlargement?': ' the cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it’s linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older. read more about the causes of benign prostate enlargement'}, {'how is benign prostate enlargement diagnosed?': ' if your gp suspects that you have an enlarged prostate, you’ll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms. each question has 5 possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score indicates the severity of your symptoms. your gp will also want to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to prostate enlargement. you may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a\xa0blood test that measures psa. read more about diagnosing benign prostate enlargement'}, {'treating benign prostate enlargement': ' treatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms. if you have mild to moderate\xa0symptoms, you won’t receive any immediate medical treatment, but you’ll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate. you’ll probably also be advised to make\xa0lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine and\xa0alcohol intake, and exercising regularly,\xa0to see if they improve your symptoms. as well as\xa0lifestyle changes, medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.\xa0finasteride and dutasteride are medications\xa0that are commonly used. they block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (dht) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve associated symptoms. alpha blockers may also be prescribed. they help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication. read more about treating benign prostate enlargement'}, {'complications of benign prostate

the complications of benign prostate enlargement'}, {'how common is benign prostate enlargement?': ' benign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age.'}, {'symptoms of benign prostate enlargement': ' the symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are caused by the enlarged prostate placing pressure on the bladder and urethra (which carries urine from the bladder to the penis). this can affect urination in a number of ways. for example, it can:make it difficult for you to start urinating weaken the\xa0flow of urine or cause ‘stopping and starting’ cause you to strain to pass urine cause you to need to urinate\xa0frequently cause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate cause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result in\xa0urinary incontinence if you can’t find a toilet quickly enough cause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully cause blood in the urine (haematuria) in the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as\xa0bladder stones,\xa0bladder infections and kidney damage.'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' see\xa0your gp if you notice any problems with, or changes to,\xa0your usual pattern of urination. even if the symptoms are mild, they could be caused by a condition that needs to be investigated. any\xa0blood in the urine must be investigated by your gp to rule out other more serious conditions.'}, {'causes of benign prostate enlargement': ' the exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown, but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition’s development. hormones are powerful chemicals that can have a wide range of effects on the cells of the body. one theory is that as some men and anyone with a prostate gets older, the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (dht) increases, which may stimulate the growth of the prostate. another theory suggests that two hormones, testosterone and oestrogen, play a role. younger men and anyone with a prostate produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. but as they get older, levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. it’s been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth.'}, {'risk factors': ' research has shown that rates of benign prostate enlargement are higher among men and anyone with a prostate with high blood pressure and diabetes. however, both diabetes and high blood pressure are associated with the natural ageing process, so there may not be a direct connection between the three conditions.'}, {'diagnosing benign prostate enlargement': ' to find out whether your prostate gland is enlarged, you’ll need to have a few tests. some tests will be carried out by your gp and others will be carried out by a urologist (a doctor who specialises in urinary problems). first, your gp will ask about your symptoms. if it seems that you have symptoms of benign prostate enlargement, the next stage is to calculate your\xa0international prostate

of not completely emptying your bladder after urinating? have you had to urinate again less than 2 hours after finishing urinating? have you found that you stopped and started again when urinating? have you found it difficult to postpone urination? have you had a weak stream of urine? have you had to push or strain to begin urinating during the course of one night? have\xa0you had to\xa0get up

is often referred to as ‘watchful waiting’. you may also be advised to make lifestyle\xa0changes to see whether they improve your symptoms.'}, {'lifestyle changes': ' if your prostate gland is enlarged, you may be advised to:avoid drinking any liquids for 1 to 2 hours before going to bed – this will reduce your chances of waking up during the night to pass urine (nocturia) experiment with the time you take prescribed medication – for example, taking it\xa0at 7pm may help prevent nocturia stop drinking\xa0alcohol and caffeine, or limit your consumption of them – these drinks\xa0can irritate your bladder and make your symptoms worse exercise regularly\xa0– research shows moderate exercise, such as walking for 30 to 60 minutes a day, can improve symptoms, although it’s unclear exactly why this is the case join a patient support group – your doctor should be able to recommend one, which\xa0may help you manage mild symptoms without the need for medication'}, {'bladder training': ' bladder training is an exercise programme that aims to increase the time between urination and the amount of urine your bladder can hold. you’ll be given a target, such as waiting at least 2 hours between each time you urinate. it’s a good idea to use a bladder training chart, which allows you to record each time you pass urine and the volume of urine passed\xa0– you’ll need a plastic jug to measure this. your doctor should give you a chart to take home. you’ll also be taught a number of exercises, such as breathing, relaxation and muscle exercises, to help take your mind off the need to urinate. over time your target time will be increased, and at the end of the programme you should find that you’re able to go for longer without urinating. bladder training should only be carried out under medical supervision.'}, {'medication': ' medication, in combination with the lifestyle changes above, is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.'}, {'surgery': ' surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement\xa0that have failed to respond to medication. various

as a tumour, develops in the bladder lining. in some cases, the tumour spreads into the surrounding muscles. the most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in your urine, which is usually painless. if you notice blood in your urine, even if it comes and goes, you should speak to your gp, so the cause can be investigated. read about the symptoms of bladder cancer'}, {'types of bladder cancer': ' once diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has\xa0spread. if the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\xa0this is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 7 out of 10 cases.\xa0most people don’t die as a result\xa0of\xa0this type of bladder cancer. when the cancerous cells spread beyond the lining, into the surrounding muscles of the bladder, it’s referred to as muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\xa0this is less common,\xa0but has a higher chance\xa0of spreading to other parts of the body and can be fatal. if bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it’s known as locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. read more about diagnosing bladder cancer'}, {'why does bladder cancer happen?': ' most cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder’s cells over many years. tobacco smoke is a common cause and\xa0it’s estimated that half of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking. contact with certain chemicals previously\xa0used in manufacturing is also known to cause bladder cancer. however, these substances have since\xa0been banned. read more about the causes of bladder cancer\xa0and preventing bladder cancer'}, {'treating bladder cancer': ' in cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it’s usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact. this is done using a surgical technique called transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (turbt).\xa0this\xa0is followed by a dose of chemotherapy medication directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. in cases with a higher risk of recurrence, a medication known as bacillus calmette-guérin (bcg) may be\xa0injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. treatment for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or muscle-invasive bladder cancer may involve surgically removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy. when the bladder is removed, you’ll need another way of\xa0collecting your urine. possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external\xa0bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. this will be done at the same time as a cystectomy. if it’s possible to avoid removing the bladder, or if surgery\xa0is not suitable, a course of radiotherapy\xa0and\xa0chemotherapy may be recommended. chemotherapy may sometimes be used on its own before surgery or before being combined with radiotherapy. after treatment for all types of bladder cancer, you’ll have regular follow-up tests to check for signs of recurrence. read more about treating bladder cancer'}, {'who is affected?': ' bladder cancer\xa0is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new\xa0cases

dangerously low level icus can support body functions like breathing that are affected by sepsis. this allows the medical staff to focus on treating the infection. sepsis is treatable if it’s identified and treated quickly. in most cases it leads to full recovery with no lasting problems.'}, {'antibiotics': ' the main treatment for sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock is antibiotics. these will be given directly into a vein (intravenously). ideally, antibiotic treatment should start within an hour of diagnosis. intravenous antibiotics are usually replaced by tablets after 2 to 4 days. you may have to take them for 7 to 10 days or longer, depending on the severity of your condition.'}, {'viral infections': ' if the sepsis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won’t work. however, it would be too dangerous to delay treatment to find out the specific cause. this means antibiotics are usually given anyway. with a viral infection, you’ll need to wait until your immune system starts to tackle it. however, antiviral medication may be given in some cases.'}, {'intravenous fluids': ' if you have sepsis, your body needs more fluid to prevent dehydration and kidney failure. if you have severe sepsis or septic shock, you’ll usually be given fluids intravenously for the first 24 to 48 hours. it’s important that the doctors know how much urine your kidneys are making when you have sepsis. this helps them spot signs of kidney failure. if you’re admitted with severe sepsis or septic shock, you’ll usually be given a catheter. this is inserted into your bladder to monitor your urine output.'}, {'oxygen': ' your body’s oxygen demand goes up if you have sepsis. if you’re admitted to hospital with sepsis and the level of oxygen in your blood is low, you’ll usually be given oxygen. this is given through a mask or tubes in your nostrils.'}, {'treating the source of infection': ' if a source of the infection can be identified, like an abscess or infected wound, this will also need to be treated. for example, any pus may need to be drained away. in more serious cases, surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair any damage.'}, {'increasing blood pressure': ' medications called vasopressors are used if you have low blood pressure caused by sepsis. vasopressors are normally given intravenously while you’re in an icu. extra fluids may also be given intravenously to help increase blood pressure.'}, {'other treatments': ' you may require additional treatments like:corticosteroids insulin medication a blood transfusion mechanical ventilation

in particular, a condition called paget’s disease of the bone\xa0can increase the risk of bone cancer in people over 50\xa0to 60 years of age. rarer conditions that cause tumours to grow in your bones, such as ollier’s disease, can also increase your risk of bone cancer.'}, {'genetic conditions': ' a rare genetic condition called\xa0li-fraumeni syndrome can increase your risk of developing bone cancer, as well as several other types of cancer. people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that usually helps stop the growth of tumours in the body.'}, {'other conditions': ' people who had a rare type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma\xa0as a child may be more likely to develop bone cancer, because the same inherited faulty gene can be responsible for both conditions. research has also found that babies born with an umbilical hernia\xa0are three times more likely to develop a type of bone cancer called ewing sarcoma,\xa0although the risk is still\xa0very small.'}, {'diagnosing bone cancer': ' if you’re experiencing bone pain, your gp will ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area, before deciding whether you need to have any further tests. they will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have\xa0problems moving the affected area. they may ask about the type of pain you experience – whether it’s constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse. after being examined, you may be\xa0referred for an x-ray of the affected area to look for any problems in the bones. if the x-ray shows abnormal areas, you’ll be referred to\xa0an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone conditions) or bone cancer specialist\xa0for a further assessment.'}, {'x-rays': ' an x-ray\xa0is a procedure where radiation is used to\xa0produce images of the inside of the body. it’s a particularly effective way of looking at bones. x-rays can often detect damage to the bones caused by cancer, or new bone that’s growing because of cancer.\xa0they can also determine whether your symptoms are\xa0caused by\xa0something else, such as a broken\xa0bone (fracture). if\xa0an x-ray suggests you may have bone cancer, you should be referred to a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and treating the condition. as bone cancer is\xa0rare,\xa0there are a\xa0small number of specialist centres, so you may have to travel outside your local area for advice and treatment.'}, {'biopsy': ' the most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. this is known as a biopsy. a biopsy can determine exactly what type of bone cancer you have and what grade it is (see below). a biopsy can be\xa0carried out\xa0in two ways:a core needle biopsy is\xa0performed under anaesthetic (depending on where the bone is located, this could be a\xa0local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic).\xa0a thin needle is inserted into the bone and used to remove a sample of tissue. an open biopsy is\xa0performed under a general anaesthetic. the surgeon makes an incision in the affected bone to remove a sample of tissue. you may need to have an open biopsy if the results of a core needle biopsy are inconclusive.'}, {'further tests': ' if the results of the biopsy confirm or suggest bone cancer, it’s likely you’ll have further tests to assess how far the cancer has spread. these tests are described below.'}, {'staging and grading': ' once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you what stage and grade the bone cancer is. staging is a description of how far a cancer has spread and grading is a description of how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. a widely used staging system for bone cancer in\xa0the uk\xa0uses 3 main stages:stage 1 – the cancer is low-grade and has not spread beyond the bone stage 2 – the cancer has still not spread beyond the bone, but is a high-grade stage 3 \xa0– the cancer has spread into other parts of the body, such as the lungs most cases of stage 1 bone cancer and some stage 2 bone cancers have a good\xa0chance of being cured. unfortunately, stage 3 bone cancer is more difficult to cure, although treatment can relieve symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer.'}, {'coping with a diagnosis': ' being told\xa0you have bone cancer can be a distressing and frightening experience. receiving that type of news can be upsetting at any age, but can be particularly difficult if you are still in your teenage years, or\xa0if you’re a parent of a child who has just been told\xa0they have bone cancer. these types of feelings can cause considerable stress and anxiety, which in some cases can trigger\xa0depression. if you think you may be depressed,\xa0your gp may be a good person to talk to about support and possibly\xa0treatment. you may also find it useful to contact the bone cancer research trust, which is the uk’s leading charity for people affected by bone cancer, if you need more information. if you’re a teenager you may want to contact the teenage cancer trust, which is a charity for teenagers and young adults affected by cancer. read more about coping with a cancer diagnosis'}, {'treating bone cancer': ' treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have, how far it has spread and your general health. the main treatments are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.'}, {'your treatment plan': ' your treatment should be managed by a specialist centre with experience in treating bone cancer, where you’ll be cared for by a team of different healthcare professionals known as a multi-disciplinary team (mdt). members of the mdt will include an orthopaedic surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in bone and joint surgery), a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer) and a specialist cancer nurse, among others. your mdt will recommend what they think is the best treatment for you, but the final decision will be yours. your recommended treatment plan may include a combination of:surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it’s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that’s been removed, although amputation\xa0is occasionally necessary chemotherapy\xa0–\xa0treatment\xa0with powerful cancer-killing medication radiotherapy\xa0–\xa0where\xa0radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells in some cases, a medication called mifamurtide may be recommended as well.'}, {'surgery': ' surgery to remove the cancerous area of bone is an important part of treatment for bone cancer, although it’s often combined with the other treatments mentioned below. nowadays, it’s usually possible to avoid removing an affected body part completely (known as limb-sparing surgery), although up to 1 in every 10 people may need to have a limb permanently removed (amputation).'}, {'chemotherapy': ' there are 4 ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bone cancer. it can be used:before surgery, to shrink the tumour and make surgery easier in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation)\xa0– this approach works particularly well in the treatment of\xa0ewing sarcoma after surgery, to prevent the cancer returning to control symptoms in cases where a cure is not possible (known as palliative chemotherapy) chemotherapy for bone cancer involves taking a combination of different medications that are usually delivered via a drip into your vein, or into a line inserted into a bigger blood vessel. the\xa0treatment is\xa0usually given in cycles. a cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to allow your body to recover from the effects of the treatment. the number of cycles\xa0you\xa0need will depend on the type and grade of your bone cancer.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' as with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used before and after surgery to treat bone cancer, or used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure is not possible. radiotherapy for bone cancer involves beams of radiation being directed at the cancerous section of bone by an external machine. this is normally given in daily sessions, 5 days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. the whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.'}, {'mifamurtide': ' for people with a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may be used alongside other treatments. mifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant. this means it works by encouraging the immune system to produce specialised cells\xa0that kill cancerous cells. it’s normally recommended for young people with\xa0high-grade osteosarcomas and is given\xa0after surgery, in combination with chemotherapy, to help prevent the cancer returning. mifamurtide is slowly pumped into one of your veins over the course of an hour (known as infusion). the recommended course of treatment is usually twice a week for 12 weeks, and then once a week for a further 24 weeks.'}, {'follow-up': ' once your treatment has finished, you’ll need to attend regular follow-up appointments to check\xa0the cancer hasn’t returned. you’ll be asked to attend frequent appointments in the first two years after treatment has finished – possibly every 3 months.\xa0these will\xa0become less frequent as the years go on. contact your specialist or gp if you develop\xa0symptoms of bone cancer again and think the cancer may have come back.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you':

symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains. the main symptoms are:pain\xa0or tenderness\xa0– this may start as an ache that doesn’t go away and may be made worse by exercise or feel worse at night swelling around the affected area of bone\xa0– swelling may not show up until the tumour is quite large and it isn’t always possible to see or feel a lump if the affected bone is deep inside the body reduced movement\xa0– if the bone tumour is near a joint (like an elbow or knee), it can make it harder to move the joint; if it’s in a leg bone, it may cause a limp; if it’s in the backbone (spine), it may press on nerves and cause tingling and numbness in the legs or arms a\xa0broken bone\xa0– a bone may break suddenly, or after only a minor fall or accident if the bone has been weakened by cancer. there might also be other symptoms including:tiredness a\xa0high temperature loss of appetite weight loss if you have any of these symptoms, or you are worried that you may have a bone tumour, you should get it checked by your gp. they

heart and lungs they store calcium some bones contain bone marrow, which make blood cells'}, {'joints': ' joints help bones fit together so that we can move freely. there are different types of joint. some work as levers, like the finger joint. others are ball-and-socket joints, such as the hip joint. there are different types of connective tissue that help bones move:ligaments are tough cords of

and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain blood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching, or a lump hanging down outside the back passage abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss the symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don’t necessarily make you feel ill.'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' read about the symptoms of\xa0bowel cancer, and when you should see your gp to discuss whether any tests are necessary. your doctor will probably perform a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps, as well as\xa0a simple blood test to check for\xa0iron deficiency anaemia. this can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel you haven’t been aware of. in some cases, your doctor may decide it is best to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms. make sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age. read more about diagnosing bowel cancer'}, {'bowel obstruction': ' in some cases, bowel cancer can stop digestive waste passing through the bowel. this is known as a bowel obstruction. symptoms of a bowel obstruction can include:severe abdominal pain, which may initially come and go not being able to pass stools when you go to the toilet noticeable swelling or bloating of the tummy vomiting a bowel obstruction is a medical emergency. if you suspect your bowel is obstructed, you should see your gp quickly. if this isn’t possible, go to the accident and emergency (a&e) department of your nearest hospital. read further information:beating bowel cancer: symptoms bowel cancer uk:\xa0symptoms of bowel cancer cancer

as a tumour. most cases of bowel cancer first develop inside clumps of cells on the inner lining of the bowel. these clumps are known as polyps. however, if you develop polyps, it does not necessarily mean you will get bowel cancer. exactly what causes cancer to develop inside the bowel is still unknown. however, research has shown several factors may make you more likely to develop it.'}, {'age': ' your chances of developing bowel cancer increase as you get older. almost\xa09 out of 10 cases of bowel cancer in the uk are diagnosed in people over the age of 60.'}, {'family history': ' having a family history of bowel cancer can increase your risk of developing the condition yourself, particularly if a close relative (mother, father, brother or sister) was diagnosed with bowel cancer below the age of 50. if you are particularly concerned that your family’s medical history may mean you are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, it may help to speak to your gp. if necessary, your gp can refer you to a genetics specialist, who can offer more advice about your level of risk and recommend any necessary tests to periodically check for the condition.'}, {'diet': ' a large body of evidence suggests a diet high in red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing bowel cancer. for this reason, the department of health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) a day of red and processed meat cut down to 70g a day. read more about red meat and bowel cancer risk there is also evidence that\xa0suggests a diet high in fibre could help reduce your bowel

conditions, such as\xa0heart disease. read more about stopping smoking'}, {'alcohol': ' drinking alcohol has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly if you regularly drink large amounts. read about alcohol for information and tips on cutting down'}, {'obesity': ' being overweight or obese is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly in men. if you are overweight or obese, losing weight may help lower your chances of developing the condition.'}, {'inactivity': ' people who are physically inactive have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. you can help reduce your risk of bowel and other cancers by being physically active every day. read more about health and fitness'}, {'digestive disorders': ' some conditions affecting the bowel may put you at a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. for example, bowel cancer is more common in people who have had severe\xa0crohn’s disease\xa0or ulcerative colitis for many years. if you have one of these conditions, you will usually have regular check-ups to look for signs of bowel cancer from about 10 years after your symptoms first develop. check-ups will involve examining your bowel with a colonoscope\xa0–\xa0a long, narrow flexible tube\xa0that contains\xa0a small camera\xa0–\xa0that is inserted into your rectum. the frequency of the colonoscopy examinations will increase the longer you live with the condition, and will also depend on factors such as how severe your ulcerative colitis is and if you have a family history of bowel cancer.'}, {'genetic conditions': ' there are two rare inherited conditions that can lead to bowel cancer. they are:familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) – a condition that triggers the growth of non-cancerous polyps inside the bowel hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc), also known as lynch syndrome – an inherited gene fault (mutation) that increases your bowel cancer risk although the polyps caused by fap are non-cancerous, there is a high risk that, over time, at least one will turn cancerous. most people with fap will have bowel cancer by the time they are 50. as people with fap have such a high risk of getting bowel cancer, they are often advised by their doctor to have their large bowel removed before they reach the age of 25. families affected can find support and advice from fap registries such as the polyposis registry provided by st mark’s hospital, london. removing the bowel as a precautionary measure is also usually recommended in people with hnpcc because the risk of developing bowel cancer is so high. read further information:bowel cancer uk: risk factors bowel cancer uk: diet'}, {'diagnosing bowel cancer': ' when you first see your gp, they will ask about your symptoms and whether you have a family history of bowel cancer. they will then usually carry out a simple examination of your abdomen (tummy) and your bottom, known as a digital rectal examination (dre). this is a useful way of checking whether there are any lumps in your tummy or back passage. the tests can be uncomfortable, and most people find an examination of the back passage a little embarrassing, but they take less than a minute. if your symptoms suggest you may have bowel cancer or the diagnosis is uncertain, you will be referred to your local hospital initially for a simple examination called a flexible sigmoidoscopy. in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected bowel cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.'}, {'flexible sigmoidoscopy': ' a flexible sigmoidoscopy is an examination of your rectum and some of your large bowel using a device called a sigmoidoscope. a sigmoidoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a very small camera and light. it is inserted into your rectum and up into your bowel. the camera relays images to a monitor, and can also be used to take biopsies, where a small tissue sample is removed for further analysis. it is better for your lower bowel to be as empty as possible when sigmoidoscopy is performed, so you may be asked to carry out an enema\xa0– a simple procedure to flush your bowels\xa0– at home beforehand. this should be used at least two hours before you leave home for your appointment. a sigmoidoscopy can feel uncomfortable, but it only takes a few minutes and most people go home straight after the examination.'}, {'more detailed tests': ' most people with bowel cancer can be diagnosed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. however, some cancers can only be diagnosed by a more extensive examination of the colon. the two tests used for this are colonoscopy and computerised tomography (ct) colonography.'}, {'further tests': ' if a diagnosis of bowel cancer is confirmed, further testing is usually carried out to check if the cancer has spread from the bowel to other parts of the body.\xa0these tests also help your doctors decide on the most effective treatment for you. these tests can include a:ct scan of your abdomen and chest –\xa0this will check if the rest of your bowel is healthy and whether the cancer has spread to the liver or lungs magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan\xa0– this can provide a detailed image of the surrounding organs in people with cancer in the rectum'}, {'staging and grading': ' once the above examinations and tests have been completed, it should be possible to determine the stage and grade of your cancer. staging refers to how far your cancer has advanced. grading relates to how aggressive your cancer is\xa0and how\xa0likely it is\xa0to spread. this is important, as it helps your treatment team choose the best way of curing or controlling the cancer. a number of different staging systems are used by doctors.stage 1 – the cancer is still contained within the lining of the bowel or rectum stage 2 – the cancer has spread beyond the layer of muscle surrounding the bowel and may have penetrated the surface covering the bowel or nearby organs stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes stage 4 – the cancer has spread beyond the bowel into another part of the body, such as the liver there are 3 grades of bowel cancer:grade 1 – a cancer that grows slowly and has a low chance of spreading beyond the bowel grade 2 – a cancer that grows moderately and has a medium chance of spreading beyond the bowel grade 3 – a cancer that grows rapidly and has a high chance of spreading beyond the bowel if you are not sure what stage or grade of cancer you have, ask your doctor.'}, {'treating bowel cancer': ' if\xa0colon cancer is at a very early stage, it may be possible to remove just a small piece of the lining of the colon wall. this is known as local excision. if the cancer spreads into\xa0muscles surrounding the colon, it will usually be necessary to remove an entire section of your colon.\xa0this is known as a colectomy. there are 2 ways a colectomy can be performed:an open colectomy – where the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon a laparoscopic (keyhole) colectomy – where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of colon during surgery, nearby lymph nodes are also removed. it is usual to join the ends of the bowel together after bowel cancer surgery, but very occasionally this is not possible and a stoma is needed. both open and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective at removing cancer and have similar risks of complications. however, laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of a faster recovery time and less postoperative pain. it is becoming the routine way of doing most of these operations. laparoscopic colectomies should be available in all hospitals that carry out bowel cancer surgery, although not all surgeons perform this type of surgery. discuss your options with your surgeon to see if this method can be used.'}, {'surgery for rectal cancer': ' there are a number of different types of operation that can be carried out to treat rectal cancer, depending on how far the cancer has spread. some of the main techniques used are described below:'}, {'stoma surgery': ' where a section of the bowel is removed and the remaining bowel joined, the surgeon may sometimes decide to divert your stool away from the join to allow it to heal. the stool is temporarily diverted by bringing a loop of bowel out through the abdominal wall and attaching it to the skin – this is called a stoma. a bag is worn over the stoma to collect the stool. when the stoma is made from the small bowel (ileum) it is called an ileostomy, and when it is made from the\xa0large bowel (colon) it is called a colostomy. a specialist nurse, known as a stoma care nurse, can advise you on the best site for a stoma\xa0prior to surgery. the nurse will take into account factors such as your body shape and lifestyle, although this may not be possible where surgery is performed in an emergency. in\xa0the first few days\xa0after surgery, the stoma care nurse will advise on the care necessary to look after the stoma and the type of bag suitable. once the join in the bowel has safely healed, which can take several weeks, the stoma can be closed\xa0during further surgery. in some people, for various reasons, rejoining the bowel may not be possible or may lead to problems controlling bowel function, and the stoma may become permanent. before having surgery, the care team will advise you about whether it may be necessary to form an ileostomy or colostomy, and the likelihood of this being temporary or permanent. there are patient support groups available that provide support for patients who have just had or are about to have a stoma. you can\xa0get more\xa0details from\xa0your stoma care nurse, or visit the groups\xa0online for further information. ileostomy and internal pouch support group\xa0provides a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery learn more about\xa0coping with a stoma after bowel cancer'}, {'side effects of surgery': ' bowel cancer operations carry many of the same risks as other major operations, including bleeding, infection, developing blood clots, or heart or breathing problems. the operations all carry a number of risks specific to the procedure. one risk is that the joined-up section of bowel may not heal properly and leak inside your abdomen. this is usually only a risk in the first few days after the operation. another risk is for people having rectal cancer surgery. the nerves that control urination\xa0and sexual function are very close to the rectum, and sometimes\xa0surgery to remove rectal cancer can damage these nerves. after rectal cancer surgery, most people need to go to the toilet to open their bowels more often than before, although\xa0this usually settles down within a few months of the operation.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' there are 2 main ways radiotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer. it can be given before surgery to shrink rectal cancers and increase the chances of complete removal, or be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of cancer in advanced cases (palliative radiotherapy). radiotherapy given before surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in 2 ways:external radiotherapy – where a machine is used to beam high-energy waves at your rectum to kill cancerous cells internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) – where a radioactive tube is inserted into your anus and placed next to the cancer to shrink it external radiotherapy is usually given daily, 5 days a week, with a break at the weekend. depending on the size of your tumour, you may need 1 to 5 weeks of treatment. each session of radiotherapy is short and will only last for 10 to 15 minutes. internal radiotherapy can usually be performed in one session before surgery is carried out a few weeks later. palliative radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions, with a course ranging from 2 to 3 days, up to 10 days. short-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:feeling sick fatigue diarrhoea burning and irritation of the skin around the rectum and pelvis\xa0–\xa0this looks and feels like sunburn a frequent need to urinate a burning sensation when passing urine these side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has finished. tell your care team if the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome. additional treatments are often available to help you cope with the side effects\xa0better. long-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:a more frequent need to pass urine or stools blood in your urine and stools infertility erectile dysfunction if you want to have children, it may be possible to store a sample of your sperm or eggs before treatment begins so they can be used in fertility treatments in the future.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' there are 3 ways\xa0chemotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer:before surgery\xa0–\xa0used in combination with radiotherapy\xa0to shrink the tumour after surgery\xa0–\xa0to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring palliative chemotherapy\xa0– to slow the spread of advanced bowel cancer and help control symptoms chemotherapy for bowel cancer usually involves taking a combination of medications that kill cancer cells. they can be given as a tablet (oral chemotherapy), through a drip in your arm (intravenous chemotherapy), or as a combination of both. treatment is given in courses (cycles) that are 2 to 3 weeks long each, depending on the stage or grade of your cancer. a single session of intravenous chemotherapy can last from several hours to several days. most people having oral chemotherapy take tablets over the course of two weeks before having a break from treatment for another week. a course of chemotherapy can last up to 6 months, depending on how well you respond to the treatment. in some cases, it can be given in smaller doses over longer periods of time (maintenance chemotherapy). side effects of chemotherapy can include:fatigue feeling sick vomiting diarrhoea mouth ulcers hair loss with certain treatment regimens, but this is generally uncommon in the treatment of bowel cancer a sensation of numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet and neck these side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished. it usually takes a few months for your hair to grow back if you experience hair loss. chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. inform your care team or gp as soon as possible if you experience possible signs of an infection, including high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of being generally unwell. medications used in chemotherapy can cause temporary damage to men’s sperm and women’s eggs. this means that for women who become pregnant or for men who father a child, there is a risk to the unborn baby’s health. it\xa0is therefore\xa0recommended you use a reliable method of contraception while having chemotherapy treatment and for a period after your treatment has finished. find out more about\xa0chemotherapy'}, {'biological treatments': ' biological treatments, including cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab, are a newer type of medication also known as monoclonal antibodies. monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have been genetically engineered in a laboratory. they target special proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors (egfr). as egfrs help the cancer grow, targeting these proteins can help shrink tumours, and improve the effect and outcome of chemotherapy. biological treatments are therefore usually used in combination with chemotherapy when the cancer has spread beyond the bowel (metastatic bowel cancer). these treatments are not available to everyone with bowel cancer. the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has specific criteria\xa0that need to be met before these can be prescribed. cetuximab is only available on the nhs when:surgery to remove the cancer in the colon or rectum has been carried out or is possible bowel cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed surgically a person is fit enough to undergo surgery to remove the cancer from the liver if this becomes possible after treatment with cetuximab cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab are available on

giving you a sugary drink\xa0two hours before the operation to give you energy. during and after the operation, the anaesthetist controls the amount of iv fluid you need very carefully, and after the operation you will be given painkillers that allow you to get up and out of bed by the next day. most people will be able to eat a light diet the day after their operation. to reduce the risk of\xa0blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis), you may be given special compression stockings that help prevent blood clots, or a regular injection with a blood-thinning medication called\xa0heparin until you are fully mobile. a nurse or physiotherapist will help you get out of bed and regain your strength so you can go home within a few days. with the enhanced recovery programme, most people are well enough to go home within a week of their operation. the timing depends on when you and the doctors and nurses looking after you agree you are well enough to go home.

to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. it’s also sometimes known as faecal incontinence. the experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person. some people feel a sudden need to go to the toilet but are unable to reach a toilet in time. this is known as urge bowel incontinence. other people experience no sensation before soiling themselves, known as passive incontinence or passive soiling, or there might be slight soiling when passing wind. some people experience incontinence on a daily basis, whereas for others it only happens from time to time. it’s thought 1\xa0in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their life. it can affect people of any age, although it’s more common in elderly people. it’s also more common in women than men.'}, {'why bowel incontinence happens': ' bowel incontinence is\xa0a symptom of an underlying problem or medical condition. many cases are caused by diarrhoea, constipation, or weakening of the muscle that controls the opening of the anus. it can also be caused by long-term conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis and dementia. read more about the causes of bowel incontinence.'}, {'seeking advice

appointment at your local nhs continence service without a referral. these clinics are staffed by specialist nurses who can offer useful advice about incontinence. read more about diagnosing bowel incontinence.'}, {'how bowel incontinence is treated': ' in many cases, with the right treatment, a person can maintain normal bowel function throughout their life. treatment will often depend on the cause and how severe it is, but possible options include:lifestyle and dietary changes to relieve constipation or diarrhoea exercise programmes to strengthen the muscles that control the\xa0bowel medication to control diarrhoea and constipation surgery, of which there are a number of different options incontinence products, such as anal plugs and disposable pads, can be used until your symptoms are better controlled. even if\xa0it isn’t possible to\xa0cure your\xa0bowel incontinence, symptoms\xa0should\xa0improve significantly. read more about treating bowel incontinence.'},

damage –\xa0the nerve signals sent from the rectum don’t reach the brain these problems are explained in more detail below. it’s important to discuss any bowel problems with your gp as there’s a small chance they could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as bowel cancer.'}, {'problems with the rectum': ''}, {'problems with the sphincter muscles': ' the sphincter muscles at the bottom of the rectum control the bowel. bowel incontinence happens if these muscles become weakened or damaged. childbirth is a common cause of damage to the sphincter muscles and a leading cause of bowel incontinence. during a vaginal birth, the sphincter muscles can become stretched and damaged, particularly as a result of a forceps delivery. other causes include a large baby, the baby being born with the back of their head facing the mother’s back (occipitoposterior position) and a long labour. sphincter muscles can also become damaged through injury, or damage from bowel or rectal surgery.'}, {'nerve damage': ' bowel incontinence can also be caused by a problem with the nerves connecting the brain and the rectum. a nerve problem can mean your body is unaware of stools in your rectum, and may make it difficult for you to control your sphincter muscles. damage to these nerves is related to a number of conditions, including:diabetes multiple sclerosis (a condition of the

incontinence depends on underlying cause and the pattern of your symptoms. trying the least intrusive treatments first, such as dietary changes and exercise programmes, is often recommended. medication and surgery are usually only considered if other treatments haven’t worked.'}, {'continence products': ' you may find it helpful to use continence products until your bowel incontinence is better controlled. most continence products are available for free on the nhs. anal plugs are one way to prevent involuntary soiling. an anal plug is made of foam and designed to be inserted into your bottom. however, they can be uncomfortable and they’re not really a long term solution. if the plug comes into contact with moisture from the bowel, it expands and prevents leakage or soiling. anal plugs can be worn for up to 12 hours, after which time they are removed using an attached string. disposable body pads are contoured pads that soak up liquid stools and protect your skin. they can be used in cases of mild bowel incontinence. single-use silicone inserts, which form a seal around the rectum until your next bowel movement, are also being investigated as a treatment option for moderate to severe bowel incontinence. your local nhs continence service can offer help and advice about continence products, and you don’t usually need a referral from your gp to make an appointment. these clinics are staffed by nurses who specialise in continence treatment.'}, {'dietary changes': ' bowel incontinence associated with diarrhoea or constipation can often be controlled by making changes to your diet. it may be beneficial\xa0to keep a food diary to record the effect of your diet on your symptoms.'}, {'pelvic floor muscle training': ' pelvic floor muscle training is a type of exercise programme used to treat cases of bowel incontinence caused by weakness in the pelvic floor muscles. a therapist, usually a physiotherapist or specialist nurse, will teach you a range of exercises. the goal of pelvic floor muscle training is to strengthen any muscles that may have been stretched and weakened. you’ll probably be required to carry out the exercises 3\xa0times a day, for 6\xa0to 8\xa0weeks. after this time, you should notice an improvement in your symptoms.'}, {'bowel retraining': ' bowel retraining is a type of treatment for people with reduced sensation in their rectum as a result of nerve damage, or for those who have recurring episodes of constipation. there are 3\xa0goals in bowel retraining:to improve the consistency of your stools to establish a regular time for you to empty your bowels to find ways of stimulating your bowels to empty themselves changes to your diet usually improve stool consistency (see above). establishing a regular time to empty your bowels means\xa0finding the most convenient time when you can\xa0go to the toilet without being rushed. ways to stimulate bowel movements can differ from person to person. some people find a hot drink and meal can help. others may need to stimulate their anus using their finger.'}, {'medication': ' medication can be used to help treat soft or loose stools or constipation associated with bowel incontinence. loperamide\xa0is a\xa0medicine widely\xa0used to treat diarrhoea. it works by slowing down the movement of stools through the digestive system, allowing more water to be absorbed from the stools. loperamide can be prescribed in low doses to be taken regularly over a long period of time. laxatives\xa0are used to treat constipation. they’re a type of medicine that helps you to pass stools. bulk-forming laxatives are usually recommended.\xa0these help your stools to retain fluid. this means they’re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction.'}, {'enemas or rectal irrigation': ' rectal irrigation or enemas\xa0are used when bowel incontinence is caused by faecal impaction and other treatments have failed to remove the impacted stool from the rectum. these procedures involve\xa0a small tube that is placed into your anus. a special solution is then used to wash out your rectum.'}, {'surgery': ' surgery is usually only recommended after all other treatment options have been tried. the main surgical treatments used on the nhs are sphincteroplasty and sacral nerve stimulation. other treatments – such as tibial nerve stimulation, endoscopic heat therapy and artificial sphincter surgery – can also be used, but their availability on the nhs is limited. an operation called a colostomy is more widely available on the nhs, but it’s only used if

for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely. if you’re worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your gp. read about predictive genetic tests for cancer risk genes'}, {'previous diagnosis of breast cancer': ' if you’ve previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast again.'}, {'previous benign breast lump': ' a\xa0benign breast lump doesn’t mean\xa0you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may slightly increase your risk of developing it. certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (cells growing abnormally in ducts), or lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells inside your breast lobes), can make getting breast cancer more likely.'}, {'breast density': ' your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules), which produce milk. this glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser. women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous. dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, because it makes any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue harder to spot. younger women tend to have denser breasts. as you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.'}, {'exposure to oestrogen': ' the female hormone, oestrogen,\xa0can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to\xa0grow. the ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start\xa0puberty, to regulate your periods. your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen\xa0your body is exposed to. for example, if you started your\xa0periods at a young age and experienced the\xa0menopause at a late age, you’ll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time. in the same way, not having children, or having children later in life, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy.'}, {'being overweight or obese': ' if you’ve experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer. this is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, because being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.'}, {'being tall': ' if you’re taller than average, you’re more likely to develop breast cancer than someone who’s shorter than average.\xa0the reason for this isn’t fully understood, but it may be due to interactions between genes, nutrition and hormones.'}, {'alcohol': ' your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink.'}, {'radiation': ' certain medical procedures that use radiation, like x-rays\xa0and computerised tomography (ct) scans, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer. if you had\xa0radiotherapy to your chest area for hodgkin lymphoma\xa0when you were a child, you should have already received a written invitation from the department of health for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer. speak to your gp if you weren’t contacted, or if you didn’t attend a consultation. if you currently need radiotherapy for hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.'}, {'hormone replacement therapy (hrt)': ' hormone replacement therapy (hrt) is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. both combined hrt and oestrogen-only hrt can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined hrt. read further information:breast cancer now: breast cancer causes macmillan cancer support: risk factors for breast cancer'}, {'diagnosing breast cancer': ' if you have suspected breast cancer, either\xa0because of\xa0your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you’ll be referred to a specialist breast clinic for further tests.'}, {'what to expect at the breast clinic': ' the tests you’ll receive at the breast clinic depend on your current symptoms, your age, and the results of the initial examination you’ll have when you arrive. many people don’t need any further tests after the initial examination. most of the time you can expect to spend up to 2 hours at the breast clinic.'}, {'further tests for breast cancer': ' if a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and to work out the best method of treatment. if\xa0your\xa0cancer was detected through the nhs breast screening programme, you’ll have further tests in the screening centre before being referred for treatment.'}, {'stage and grade of breast cancer': ''}, {'treating breast cancer': ' surgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer. the type of surgery you undergo will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. surgery is usually followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. again, the treatment you’ll have will depend on\xa0your type of breast cancer. your doctor will discuss the most suitable treatment\xa0plan with you. chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.'}, {'secondary breast cancer': ' most breast cancers are discovered in the condition’s early stages. however, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it’s spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis). if this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. secondary cancer, also called ‘advanced’ or ‘metastatic’ cancer, isn’t curable and treatment aims to achieve remission (where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full). read further information about\xa0secondary breast cancer'}, {'surgery': ' there are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery. they are:surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery surgery to remove the whole breast, which is called a mastectomy in many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed. studies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.'}, {'breast-conserving surgery': ' breast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where\xa0just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where\xa0up to a quarter of the breast is removed. if you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on the:type of cancer you have size of the tumour and where it is in your breast amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed size of your breasts your surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. if there’s no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there’s less chance that the cancer will reoccur. if cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast. after having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.'}, {'mastectomy': ' a mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. if there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy. if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm).'}, {'reconstruction': ' breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). it can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast. read further information about\xa0breast reconstruction'}, {'lymph node surgery': ' to find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy\xa0may be carried out. the sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. they’re part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). the position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they’re identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye. the sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. this provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread. if there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. it’s usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. if you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. you’ll probably have radiotherapy sessions 3 to 5 days a week, for 3 to 6 weeks. each session will only last a few minutes. the type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. the types available are:breast radiotherapy – after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue chest wall radiotherapy – after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall breast boost – some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis) radiotherapy to the lymph nodes – where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes the side effects of radiotherapy include:irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin fatigue (extreme tiredness) lymphoedema\xa0(excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm) read further information about\xa0radiotherapy for breast cancer'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. it’s usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven’t been removed. this is called adjuvant chemotherapy. in some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. this is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. several different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. the choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it’s spread. chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means\xa0you won’t have to stay in hospital overnight. the medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein. in some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. you may have chemotherapy sessions once every 2 to 3 weeks, over a period of 4 to 8 months, to give your body a rest in between treatments. the main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. side effects include:infections loss of appetite nausea and vomiting tiredness hair loss sore mouth many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe. chemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers. if you haven’t experienced the menopause, your periods may\xa0stop while you’re undergoing chemotherapy treatment. after you’ve finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again. however, this doesn’t always happen and you may enter an early menopause. this is more likely in women over 40 years old, because\xa0they’re closer to menopausal age. your doctor will discuss with you the impact that any treatment will have on your fertility. chemotherapy for secondary breast cancer if your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won’t cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life. read further information about\xa0chemotherapy for breast cancer'}, {'hormone treatment': ' some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body. these types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects. the type of hormone therapy you’ll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it’s sensitive to, your age, whether you’ve experienced\xa0the menopause and what other type of treatment you’re having. you’ll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it’s sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove. hormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you from having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. in most cases, you’ll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after\xa0having surgery. if your breast cancer isn’t sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.'}, {'biological therapy (targeted therapy)': ' some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2). these cancers are called her2-positive. biological therapy works by stopping the effects of her2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells. if you have high levels of the her2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you’ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. trastuzumab, also known by the brand name herceptin,\xa0is usually used after chemotherapy.'}, {'clinical trials': ' a great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment. these advances were discovered in clinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones. all cancer trials in the uk are carefully overseen to ensure they’re worthwhile and safely conducted. in fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those\xa0in routine care. if you’re asked to take part in a trial, you’ll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you’ll be asked to

condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it. it’s\xa0much less common in men than women. the cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. the most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. however, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by\xa0a condition called gynaecomastia. this is a common non-cancerous

for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it’s diagnosed. breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue. unfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread. read more about\xa0diagnosing breast

increase your risk of developing the condition.'}, {'age': ' like many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. it’s rare for young men to\xa0develop the condition.'}, {'genetics and family history': ' a genetic mutation is\xa0a permanent alteration in the dna sequence that makes up a gene.\xa0the result is that\xa0one or more of the body’s processes may not work in the way they should. there are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. the most significant mutation identified is known as the brca2 mutation. there’s also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer,\xa0such as a mother or sister. routine testing for the faulty genes that cause breast cancer in men isn’t usually carried out on the nhs, unless specifically requested by a specialist. however,\xa0some private clinics may offer gene testing. tests can be expensive, with prices ranging from around £2,000 to £3,000.'}, {'oestrogen': ' there’s evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men. compared\xa0with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. these include:hormone treatments – man-made (synthetic) versions of oestrogen are often used to treat prostate cancer, and are also given to transgender patients\xa0undergoing a male to female sex change obesity – obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal cirrhosis – this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-term alcohol misuse there is also a rare genetic condition affecting males called klinefelter syndrome. this is a congenital condition that\xa0boys are born with that means\xa0those who are\xa0affected\xa0produce less of the hormone testosterone than usual. as testosterone usually helps to limit the effect of oestrogen, men with klinefelter syndrome are more likely to develop breast cancer than the general male population.'}, {'occupational risks': ' there’s some evidence men who work in hot environments are twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with men who work in cooler environments. environments linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in men include:blast furnaces steelworks rolling mills – a factory where metal (usually steel) is shaped using rollers car manufacturing plants one hypothesis to help explain the link between working environment and the increased risk of developing breast cancer is that excessive heat may damage the testicles, which could lead to an increase in oestrogen levels. another hypothesis is that working in hot environments usually involves exposure to certain chemicals that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men. rates of breast cancer are also unusually high in men who manufacture perfumes and soaps. they are 7 times more likely to develop breast cancer than the male population at large. the reason for this increased risk is still unclear. exposure to certain chemicals seems to be an obvious possibility, but this hasn’t yet been proven.'}, {'radiation': ' exposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men. research has found men who received a course of radiotherapy\xa0– where high energy x-rays are used to kill cancerous cells\xa0–\xa0directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared\xa0with the population at large. however, even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low.'}, {'diagnosing breast cancer in men': ' if you have symptoms of breast cancer, such as a hard, painless lump in one of your breasts, your gp will carefully examine you. during the examination, they’ll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands). it’s likely your gp will refer you for further tests if there’s a possibility you may have breast cancer.'}, {'mammogram': ' a mammogram is a type of x-ray used to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer. during the mammogram procedure, a radiographer (a specialist in taking x-rays) will compress one of your breasts between two x-ray plates. this shouldn’t be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable. once your breast has been correctly positioned, an x-ray will be taken that produces a clear image of the inside of your breast. the procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.'}, {'ultrasound': ' an ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb. an ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. the image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts.'}, {'biopsy': ' a biopsy may be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts. a biopsy is a test that can either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of breast cancer in men. it involves taking a sample of suspected cancerous tissue and examining it in a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells. a type of biopsy known as a core biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis of breast cancer in men. this type of biopsy can usually indicate whether the cancer has started to spread from the breast into the surrounding area. during a core biopsy, a local anaesthetic will be used to numb your breast. a hollow needle will then be used to remove a number of small tissue samples from the breast lump. if cancer is found, it’s also possible to check whether there are special proteins, known as oestrogen receptors, on the surface of the cancerous cells. this is important, because if oestrogen receptors are found\xa0– and they are in more than half\xa0of cases\xa0–\xa0it’s possible to treat the cancer with hormone therapy. read\xa0treating breast cancer in men for more information.'}, {'staging': ' after breast cancer has been diagnosed, your care team should provide information about the stage of the cancer. staging is a system used to describe how far a cancer has spread at the point of diagnosis. a cure may be possible if breast cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. however, treatment can only be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer if it’s diagnosed at a later stage. unfortunately, more than 40% of breast cancers in men are diagnosed at a late stage. in some cases, men are diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis). this means there are cancer cells in the breast, but they’re contained within the breast ducts and can’t spread. if left untreated, dcis can lead to invasive breast cancer over a period of time.'}, {'coping with a diagnosis': ' being told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment. most people assume breast cancer only affects women, so it can be difficult to come to terms with the diagnosis. feelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. this may be because there’s little in the way of advice and support for men with breast cancer, particularly when compared\xa0with the support available for women with the condition. sometimes men who find themselves in this situation can become depressed. you may be depressed if you’ve felt very down and no longer interested in doing activities you used to enjoy\xa0during the past month. if you think you may be depressed, visit your gp. there is a range of effective treatments, such as medication and counselling, that can help relieve feelings of depression. you may also find it useful to talk to other men affected by the condition. breast cancer now is

history of breast cancer or those who have had radiotherapy.'}, {'treating breast cancer in men': ' treatment for breast cancer in men largely depends on how far the cancer has spread. most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) to treat men with breast cancer. these are teams of specialists\xa0who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment. deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. your cancer team will recommend what they think is the ideal treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you’d like to ask the specialist. for example, you could ask about\xa0the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.'}, {'your treatment plan': ' your recommended treatment plan depends on how far the cancer has spread. if the cancer hasn’t spread significantly beyond your breast, a complete cure may be possible. in these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. this is often followed by radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer returning. if the cancer has spread beyond your breast into other parts of your body, such as your lungs, a complete cure won’t be possible. however, hormone therapy and chemotherapy can be used to relieve symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer. more information about these treatments can be found below.'}, {'surgery': ' an operation called a mastectomy is usually recommended as the first treatment for breast cancer. a mastectomy involves removing the entire breast,\xa0sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. a procedure known as a\xa0sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed. in some cases, part of the muscle under the breast may also be removed if there’s a risk the cancer has spread to this area. once surgery has been completed, there will be a straight scar across your chest where your nipple used to be and possibly an indentation around the area where the breast tissue used to be.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy is a type of treatment involving a machine that releases high-energy waves to destroy cancerous cells. it can be given a few weeks after surgery to prevent the cancerous cells returning. a typical course of radiotherapy involves 2 to 5 sessions a week over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. the sessions are short and usually only last for 10 to 15 minutes. radiotherapy isn’t usually painful, although you’ll probably experience some side effects. this is because the energy released during radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells. common side effects of radiotherapy can include:extreme tiredness (fatigue) feeling sick (nausea) sore, red and irritated skin on the breast similar in appearance to sunburn the side effects of radiotherapy should pass after your course of treatment has finished, although some men experience prolonged fatigue for several months. radiotherapy can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve the symptoms of pain. this is known as palliative radiotherapy. palliative radiotherapy is usually given in just 1 or 2 doses and doesn’t usually cause any side effects.'}, {'hormone therapy': ' up to\xa090% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive, or er+. ‘e’ is used because the american spelling of oestrogen is ‘estrogen’. this means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow. oestrogen is a type of hormone found in low levels in men and much higher levels in women. the aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. it can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy is used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive (er+). it’s usually given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning, or it’s used to treat the symptoms of incurable cancer. chemotherapy for breast cancer involves taking a combination of cancer-killing medications. treatment is usually given every 2 to\xa03\xa0 weeks over the course of 6 months. you may be given chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy), chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy), or a combination of both. the side effects of chemotherapy can include:feeling sick being sick diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes infertility hair loss the side effects should resolve once your treatment has finished.\xa0your hair should grow back about 3 to 6 months\xa0after treatment. chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. it’s important to\xa0tell your mdt about\xa0any symptoms of a potential infection, such as:a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above flu-like symptoms, such as chills or joint pain a general sense of feeling unwell you should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection. if you’re sexually active, you should use a condom for 48 hours after receiving a dose of chemotherapy medication. this is because the medication used in chemotherapy could pass into your semen and cause irritation in the tissue of your partner’s genitals. you should avoid having children while receiving chemotherapy as many of the medications can damage your sperm and increase your chances of having a baby with a birth defect. again, using a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, is recommended depending on the medications used, it may be several months after your course of chemotherapy has ended before you can safely have children. your mdt will be able to give you a more detailed recommendation.'}, {'biological therapy': ' biological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) in cases where her2 is contributing to breast cancer. biological therapies are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they are designed to target biological processes that cancers rely on to grow and reproduce. if you have high levels of the her2 protein and\xa0are able to have biological therapy, you’ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab.\xa0also known by the brand name herceptin, it\xa0is usually used after radiotherapy or chemotherapy to prevent cancerous cells

woman’s cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina). cancer of the cervix often has no symptoms in its early stages. if you do have symptoms,\xa0the most common is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in between\xa0periods or after the menopause. abnormal bleeding doesn’t mean that you definitely have cervical cancer, but it should be investigated by your gp as soon as possible. if your gp thinks you might have cervical cancer, you should be referred to see a specialist within 2 weeks. read more about the symptoms of cervical cancer\xa0and diagnosing cervical cancer'}, {'screening for cervical cancer': ' cervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in scotland, between the ages of 25 and 64, every 5 years.\xa0you may be recalled more often depending on your test results. those on non-routine screening (where screening results have shown changes that need further investigation or follow up) will be invited up to 70 years of age. if you have unusual discharge, or bleeding after sex, between periods or after the menopause, contact your gp practice. these symptoms are not usually caused by cancer but it’s important to have them checked. you\xa0will be sent a letter confirming when your screening appointment is due. contact your gp if you think you may be overdue for a screening appointment. read more about cervical screening'}, {'what causes cervical cancer?': ' almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (hpv). hpv is a very common virus that can be passed on through any type of sexual contact with a man or a woman. there are more than 100 different types of hpv, many of which are harmless. however, some types of hpv can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix, which can eventually lead to cervical cancer. two strains of the hpv virus (hpv 16 and hpv 18)\xa0are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer.\xa0these types of hpv infection don’t have any symptoms, so many women won’t realise they have the infection. however, it’s important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who\xa0have\xa0them don’t develop cervical cancer. using condoms during sex offers some protection against hpv, but it can’t always prevent infection, because the virus is also spread through skin-to-skin contact of the wider genital area. since 2008, a\xa0hpv vaccine\xa0has been routinely offered to girls aged 12 and 13. read more about the causes of cervical cancer\xa0and preventing cervical cancer'}, {'treating cervical cancer': ' if cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it’s usually possible to treat it using surgery. in some cases, it’s possible to leave the womb in place, but it\xa0may need to be removed. the surgical procedure used to remove the womb is\xa0called a hysterectomy. radiotherapy is an alternative to surgery for some women with early-stage cervical cancer. in some cases, it’s used alongside surgery. more advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. some of the treatments used can have significant and long-lasting side effects, including early menopause\xa0and infertility. read more about treating cervical cancer'}, {'complications': ' many women with cervical cancer will have complications. these can arise as a direct result of the cancer or as a side effect of treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and\xa0surgery. complications associated with cervical cancer can range from the relatively minor, such as minor bleeding from the vagina or\xa0having to urinate frequently, to life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or kidney failure. read more about the complications of cervical cancer'}, {'outlook': ' the stage at which cervical cancer is diagnosed is an important factor in determining outlook. the staging, given as a number from 1 to 4, indicates how far the cancer has spread. the chances of living for at least 5 years after being diagnosed with cervical cancer are:stage 1 – 80-99% stage 2 – 60-90% stage 3 – 30-50% stage 4 – 20% read more about the staging of cervical cancer'}, {'who’s affected by cervical cancer?': ' following the success of the nhs cervical screening programme and the early detection of cell changes, the number of cervical cancer cases in the uk has reduced. around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the uk each year. it’s possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, but the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25.'}, {'symptoms of cervical cancer': ' the symptoms of cervical cancer aren’t always obvious, and it may not cause any symptoms at all until it’s reached an advanced stage. this is why it’s very important that you attend all of your cervical screening appointments.'}, {'unusual bleeding': ' in most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. it usually occurs after having sex. bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly period is also considered unusual. this includes bleeding after the\xa0menopause (when a woman’s monthly periods stop). visit your gp for advice if you experience any type of unusual vaginal bleeding.'}, {'other symptoms': ' other symptoms of cervical cancer may include pain and discomfort during sex and an unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge.'}, {'advanced cervical cancer': ' if the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including:constipation blood in your urine (haematuria) loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) bone pain swelling of one of your legs severe pain in your side or back caused by swelling in your kidneys, related to a\xa0condition called hydronephrosis changes to your bladder and bowel habits loss of appetite weight loss tiredness and a lack of energy'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' you should contact your gp if you experience:bleeding after sex (postcoital bleeding) bleeding outside of your normal periods new bleeding after the menopause vaginal bleeding is very common and can have a wide range of causes, so it doesn’t necessarily mean you have cervical cancer. however, unusual vaginal bleeding is a symptom that needs to be investigated by your gp.'}, {'causes of cervical cancer': ' in almost all cases, cervical cancer is the result of a change in cell dna caused by the human papilloma virus (hpv). cancer begins with a change in the structure of the dna that’s present in all human cells. dna provides the cells with a basic set of instructions, including when to grow and reproduce. a change in the dna’s structure is known as a mutation. it can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means the cells continue growing instead of stopping when they should. if the cells reproduce uncontrollably, they produce a lump of tissue called a tumour.'}, {'human papilloma virus (hpv)': ' more than\xa099% of cervical cancer\xa0cases occur in women who have been previously infected with hpv. hpv is a group of viruses, rather than a single virus. there are more than 100 different types. hpv is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity (such as skin-to-skin contact of the genital areas, or using sex toys) and is thought to be very common.\xa0it’s estimated that 1 in 3 women will develop an hpv infection within 2 years of starting to have regular sex, and about 4 in 5\xa0women will develop the infection at some point in their lives. some types of hpv don’t cause any noticeable symptoms and the infection will pass without treatment. other types of hpv can cause genital warts, although these types aren’t linked to an increased risk of causing cervical cancer. about 15 types of hpv are considered high-risk for cervical cancer. the 2 types known to have the highest risk are hpv 16 and hpv 18, which\xa0cause about 7 out of every 10 cervical cancers. high-risk types of hpv are thought to contain genetic material that can be passed into the cells of the cervix. this material begins to disrupt the normal workings of the cells, which can eventually cause them to reproduce uncontrollably, leading to the growth of a cancerous tumour. as most types of hpv don’t cause any symptoms, you or your partner could have the virus for months or years without knowing it. see\xa0preventing cervical cancer for more information about reducing your chances of developing an hpv infection.'}, {'cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin)': ' cancer of the cervix usually takes many years to develop. before it does, the cells in the cervix often show changes known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) or, less commonly, cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (cgin). cin and cgin are pre-cancerous conditions. pre-cancerous conditions don’t pose an immediate threat to a person’s health, but they can potentially develop into cancer in the future. however, even if you develop cin or cgin, the chances of it developing into cervical cancer are very small, and if the changes are discovered during cervical screening, treatment is\xa0highly successful. the progression from becoming infected with hpv to developing cin or cgin\xa0and then developing cervical cancer is very slow, often\xa0taking 10 to 20 years. read more about cervical screening results'}, {'increased risk': ' the fact that hpv infection is very common but cervical cancer is relatively uncommon\xa0suggests that only a very small proportion of women are vulnerable to the effects of an hpv infection. there appear to be additional\xa0risk factors that affect\xa0a woman’s chance of developing cervical cancer. these include:smoking – women who smoke are twice as likely to\xa0develop cervical cancer than women who don’t; this may be caused by the harmful effects of chemicals found in tobacco on the cells of the cervix having a weakened immune system –\xa0this can occur as a result of taking certain medications, such as immunosuppressants, which are used to stop the body rejecting donated organs, or as a result of a condition such as hiv or aids taking the\xa0oral contraceptive pill for more than 5 years – women who take the pill are thought to have twice the risk of developing cervical cancer than those who don’t, although it’s not clear why having children (the more children you have, the greater your risk) – women who have 2 children have twice the risk of getting cervical cancer compared\xa0with women who don’t have any children the reason for the link between cervical cancer and childbirth is unclear. one theory is that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may make the cervix more vulnerable to the effects of hpv.'}, {'the spread of cervical cancer': ' if cervical cancer is undiagnosed and untreated, it will slowly spread out of the cervix\xa0and into the surrounding tissue and organs. the cancer can spread down to the vagina and the surrounding muscles that support the bones of the pelvis. alternatively, it can spread upwards, blocking the tube that runs from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters). the cancer\xa0can then spread into your bladder, rectum (back passage) and eventually into your liver, bones and lungs. cancerous cells can also spread through your lymphatic system. the lymphatic system is a series of nodes (glands) and channels spread throughout your body in a similar way to the blood circulation system. the lymph nodes produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). if you have an infection, the nodes in your neck or under your armpits can become swollen. in some cases of early cervical cancer, the lymph nodes close to the cervix contain cancerous cells. in some cases of advanced cervical cancer, lymph nodes in the chest and abdomen can be affected.'}, {'diagnosing cervical cancer': ' if cervical cancer is suspected, you’ll be referred to a gynaecologist (a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system). referral will be recommended if the results of your cervical screening test suggest that there are abnormalities in the cells of your cervix. however, in most cases, the abnormalities don’t mean you have cervical cancer. you may also be referred to a gynaecologist if you have abnormal vaginal\xa0bleeding, or if your gp has noticed a growth inside your cervix during an examination. the sexually transmitted infection (sti) chlamydia is one of the most common reasons why women experience unusual vaginal bleeding. your gp may recommend that you’re tested for it first before being referred. testing for chlamydia involves taking a small tissue sample from your cervix, or carrying out a urine test.'}, {'colposcopy': ' if you’ve had an abnormal cervical screening test result, or your symptoms suggest that you may have cervical cancer, your gynaecologist will usually carry out a colposcopy. this is an examination to look for abnormalities in your cervix. during a colposcopy, a small microscope with a light source at the end (colposcope) is used. as well as examining your cervix, your gynaecologist may remove a small tissue sample (biopsy) so that it can be checked under a microscope for cancerous cells.'}, {'cone biopsy': ' in some cases, a minor operation called a cone biopsy may also be carried out. the operation is carried out in hospital, usually under a local anaesthetic. during a cone biopsy, a small, cone-shaped section of your cervix will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells. you may experience vaginal bleeding for up to four weeks after the procedure. you may also have period-like pains.'}, {'further testing': ' if the results of the biopsy suggest you have cervical cancer and there’s a risk that the cancer may have spread, you’ll probably need to have some further tests to assess how widespread the cancer is. these tests may include:a pelvic examination carried out under general anaesthetic – your womb, vagina, rectum and bladder will be checked for cancer blood tests\xa0–\xa0these can be used to help assess the state of your liver, kidneys and bone marrow computerised tomography (ct) scan\xa0– scans are taken of the inside of your body and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed three-dimensional image; the ct scan can help to identify cancerous tumours and show whether cancerous cells have spread magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan\xa0– this type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the inside of your body; it can also be used to check whether cancer has spread chest x-ray\xa0– this will indicate whether cancer has spread to your lungs positive emission tomography (pet) scan\xa0–\xa0a specialised scan, where a mildly radioactive substance is injected into your veins so the cancerous tissue shows up more clearly; it’s often combined with a ct scan\xa0and is used to see if the cancer has spread, or to check how well a person is responding to treatment'}, {'staging': ' after all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell you what stage cancer you have. staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. the higher the stage, the further the cancer has spread. the staging for cervical cancer is as follows:stage 0 (pre-cancer) – there are no cancerous cells in the cervix, but there are biological changes that could trigger cancer in the future; this is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) or carcinoma in situ (cis) stage 1 – the cancer is still contained inside the cervix stage 2 – the cancer has spread outside of the cervix into the surrounding tissue, but hasn’t reached the tissues lining the pelvis (pelvic wall) or the lower part of the vagina stage 3 – the cancer has spread into the lower section of the vagina and/or into the pelvic wall stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the bowel, bladder or other organs, such as\xa0the lungs'}, {'treating cervical cancer': ' treatment for cervical cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. as cancer treatments are often complex, hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) to treat cervical cancer and tailor the treatment programme to the individual. mdts are made up of a number of different specialists who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment. your cancer team will recommend what they think\xa0the best treatment options are, but the final decision will be yours. in most cases, the recommendations will be:early cervical cancer – surgery to remove some or all of the womb,\xa0radiotherapy,\xa0or a combination advanced cervical cancer – radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, although\xa0surgery is also sometimes used the prospect of a complete cure is good for cervical cancer diagnosed at an early stage, although the chances of a complete cure decrease the further the cancer has spread. in cases where cervical cancer isn’t curable, it’s often possible to slow its progression, prolong lifespan and relieve any associated symptoms, such as pain and vaginal bleeding. this is known as\xa0palliative care.'}, {'removing abnormal cells': ' if your screening results show that you don’t have cervical cancer, but there are biological changes that could turn cancerous in the future, a number of treatment options are available. these include:large loop excision of the transformation zone (lletz) – the abnormal cells are cut away using a fine wire and an electrical current cone biopsy – the area of abnormal tissue is removed during surgery laser therapy – a laser is used to burn away the abnormal cells read more about treating abnormal cells in the cervix'}, {'surgery': ' there are 3 main types of surgery for cervical cancer. they are:radical trachelectomy – the cervix, surrounding tissue and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the womb is left in place hysterectomy – the cervix and womb are removed; depending on the stage of the cancer, it may also be necessary to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes pelvic exenteration – a major operation in which the cervix, vagina, womb, bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectum are removed'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy\xa0may be\xa0used on its own or combined with surgery\xa0for early-stage\xa0cervical cancer. it may be combined with chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer, where it can be used to control bleeding and pain. there are 2 ways that radiotherapy can be delivered. these are:externally – a machine beams high-energy waves into your pelvis to destroy cancerous cells internally – a radioactive implant is placed inside your vagina and cervix in most cases, a combination of internal and external radiotherapy will be used. a course of radiotherapy usually lasts for around 5 to 8 weeks. as well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can sometimes also harm healthy tissue.\xa0this means it can cause significant side effects many months, and even years, after treatment. however,\xa0the benefits of radiotherapy often tend to outweigh the risks. for some people, radiotherapy offers the only hope of getting rid of the cancer. side effects of radiotherapy\xa0are common and can include:diarrhoea pain when urinating bleeding from your vagina or rectum feeling very tired (fatigue) feeling sick (nausea) sore skin in your pelvis region\xa0similar to sunburn narrowing of your vagina, which can make having sex painful infertility damage to the ovaries, which will usually trigger an early menopause (if you haven’t already experienced it) bladder and bowel damage, which could lead to incontinence most of these side effects will resolve within about eight weeks of finishing treatment, although in some cases they can be permanent. it’s also possible to develop side effects several months, or even years after treatment has finished. if infertility is a concern for you, it may be possible to surgically remove eggs from your ovaries before you have radiotherapy, so that they can be implanted in your womb at a later date. however, you may have to pay for this. it may also be possible to prevent early menopause by surgically removing your ovaries and replanting them outside\xa0the area of your pelvis that will be affected by radiation. this is known as an ovarian transposition. your mdt can provide more information about the possible options for treating infertility and whether you’re suitable for an ovarian transposition.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy can be combined with radiotherapy to try\xa0to cure cervical cancer, or it can be used as a sole treatment for advanced cancer to slow\xa0its progression and relieve symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). chemotherapy involves using either a single chemotherapy medication called cisplatin or a combination of different chemotherapy medications to kill the\xa0cancerous cells. chemotherapy is usually given using an intravenous drip on an outpatient basis, so you’ll be able to go home once you’ve received your dose. as with radiotherapy, these medications can also damage healthy tissue. side effects are therefore\xa0common and can\xa0include:nausea and vomiting diarrhoea feeling tired all the time reduced production of blood cells, which can make you feel tired and breathless (anaemia) and vulnerable to infection because of a lack of white blood cells mouth ulcers loss of appetite hair loss\xa0– your hair should grow back within three to six months of your course of chemotherapy being completed, although not all chemotherapy medications cause hair loss some types of chemotherapy medication can damage your kidneys, so you may need to have regular\xa0blood tests to assess the health of your kidneys.'}, {'follow-up': ' after your treatment has been completed and the cancer has been removed, you’ll need to attend regular appointments for testing. this will usually involve a physical examination of your vagina and cervix (if it hasn’t been removed). as there’s a risk of cervical cancer returning, these examinations will be used to look for signs of this. if anything suspicious is found,\xa0a further biopsy can be carried out. if cervical cancer does return, it usually returns around 18 months after a course of treatment has been completed. follow-up appointments are usually recommended every four months after treatment has been completed for the first 2 years, and then every 6 to 12 months for a further 3 years.'}, {'complications of cervical cancer': ' complications of cervical cancer can occur as a side effect of treatment or as the result of advanced cervical cancer.'}, {'side effects': ''}, {'advanced cervical cancer': ' some of the complications that can occur in advanced cervical cancer are discussed below.'}, {'palliative care': ' if your doctors can’t do any more to treat your cancer, your care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you to be as comfortable as possible. this is called palliative care. palliative care also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers. there are different options for terminal care in the late stages of cancer. you may want to think about whether you’d like to be cared for in hospital, in a hospice or at home, and\xa0discuss these issues with your doctor. some organisations who provide care for people with cancer include:macmillan cancer support – which\xa0has specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. to be referred to a macmillan nurse, ask your hospital doctor or gp, or call 0808 808 00 00. marie curie cancer care – have specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. they also run hospices for people with cancer. hospice uk – provides information about hospice care and how to find a hospice.'}, {'living with cervical cancer': ' the impact of cervical cancer on your daily life will depend on the stage of cancer and the treatment you’re having. many women with cervical cancer have a radical hysterectomy. this is a major operation\xa0that takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from. during this time, you need to avoid strenuous tasks and lifting, such as\xa0lifting children\xa0or\xa0heavy shopping bags. you won’t be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. most women will also need 8 to 12 weeks off work to recover after having a radical hysterectomy. some of the treatments for cervical cancer can make you very tired, particularly\xa0chemotherapy and radiotherapy. because of this, you may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it. practical help may also be available from your local authority. ask your doctor or nurse about who to contact.'}, {'work': ' having cervical cancer doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to give up work, although\xa0you may need quite a lot of time off. during treatment, you may not be able to carry on as you did before. if you have cancer, you’re covered by the disability discrimination act. this means that your employer isn’t allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. they have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope. examples of these include:allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform, or your working environment the definition of what’s ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation, such as how much it would affect your employer’s business, for example. you should give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you’ll need off and when. speak to\xa0a member of your human resources department, if you have one. your union or staff association representative can also give you advice. if you’re having difficulties with your employer, your union or local citizens advice bureau may be able to help. macmillan cancer support\xa0also has more information and advice about work and cancer.'}, {'money and benefits': ' if you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. if you have cancer or you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. for example:if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you’re entitled to\xa0statutory sick pay from your employer if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to employment and support allowance if you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to carer’s allowance you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income it’s a good idea to find out what help is available as soon as possible. you could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.'}, {'your sex life': ' many women feel nervous about having sex soon after treatment for cervical cancer, but it’s perfectly safe.\xa0sex won’t make the cancer come back and your partner can’t catch cancer from you. if\xa0you want to, you can resume your normal sex life within a few weeks of finishing radiotherapy or having surgery. this will give your body time to heal. if you’re having chemotherapy,\xa0male partners should wear a\xa0condom when you have sex, because it’s not clear if having sex after chemotherapy can have an effect on them. some women find sex difficult after being treated for cervical cancer, because the\xa0side effects of some treatments can include vaginal dryness and narrowing of the vagina. in these cases, there are treatments that can help, such as vaginal dilators. see complications of cervical cancer\xa0for more information'}, {'preventing cervical cancer': ' there’s no single way to completely prevent cervical cancer, but there are things that can reduce your risk.'}, {'safer sex': ' most cases of cervical cancer are linked to an infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (hpv). hpv can be spread through unprotected sex, so using a\xa0condom can reduce your risk of developing the infection. however, the virus isn’t just passed on through penetrative sex – it can be transmitted during other types of sexual contact, such as skin-to-skin contact between genital areas and by using sex toys. your risk of developing an hpv infection increases the earlier you start having regular sex and with the more sexual partners you have, although women who have only had 1 sexual partner can also develop it. read more about sexual health'},

slow or halt the progression of the disease and can prevent other serious conditions developing. people with ckd are known to have an increased risk of a heart attack because of changes that occur to

lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of ckd developing, these include:having a healthy diet avoiding drinking excessive amounts of alcohol exercising regularly avoiding medicines that can damage the kidney read more about preventing chronic kidney disease'}, {'symptoms of chronic kidney disease': ' most people with ckd have no symptoms because the body can tolerate even a large reduction in kidney function. in other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. kidney function is often sufficient if only 1 kidney is working. that is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant. a change in kidney function is usually discovered through a routine blood or urine test. if you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your kidney function will be monitored with regular blood and urine\xa0tests, and treatment aims to keep any symptoms to a minimum. if the kidneys continue to lose function and there is progression towards kidney

(type 2 diabetes). insulin is needed to regulate\xa0levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood, preventing the levels going too high after a meal and too low between meals. if diabetes is poorly controlled, too much glucose can build up in your blood. the glucose can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys, which affects the ability of your kidneys to filter out waste products and fluids. it is estimated that 20% to 40% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop kidney disease before they reach 50 years of age. around 30% of people with type 2 diabetes also show signs of developing kidney damage. the first sign of diabetic kidney disease is the appearance of low levels of protein in the urine. therefore, your gp will ask for an annual urine test so any kidney disease can be detected as early as possible. all people with diabetes should have a kidney check every year. early detection of kidney dysfunction in diabetes is important because it identifies people at risk or

erythematosus people with blood in the urine (haematuria) or protein in the urine (proteinuria) where there is no known cause your gp can advise you about whether or not you should be screened for ckd. most often, the diagnosis of kidney disease is made because a routine blood or urine test indicates the kidneys may not be functioning normally. if this happens, the test is usually repeated to\xa0confirm the diagnosis.'}, {'glomerular filtration rate (gfr)': ' an effective way of assessing how well your kidneys are working is to calculate your glomerular filtration rate (gfr). gfr is a measurement of how many millilitres (ml) of waste fluid your kidneys can filter from the blood in a minute (measured in ml/min). a healthy pair of kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml/min. it is difficult to measure the gfr directly, so it is estimated using a formula. the result is called the estimated gfr or egfr. calculating your egfr involves taking a blood sample and measuring the levels of a waste product called creatinine and taking into account your age, gender and ethnic group. the result is similar to the percentage of normal kidney function. for example, an egfr of 50ml/min equates to 50% kidney function. the following tests are used to detect proteinuria (protein in the urine)urine tests – used to see whether there is blood or protein in your urine albumin and creatinine testing – this is another urine test which compares the amounts of albumin (a protein) and creatinine in your urine, and the ratio of the 2 (the albumin:creatinine ratio or acr) can be used with egfr to give doctors a more accurate idea of how the kidneys are functioning'}, {'staging': ' a 6-stage system, based on egfr levels, is used to describe the progression of ckd. the higher the stage, the more severe the ckd. stage 1 (sometimes called g1): the egfr is normal (above 90 or more), but other testing shows evidence of kidney damage. stage 2 (g2): the egfr has decreased slightly (60 to 89), but is still considered to be in the normal range for a young adult. if you have stage 1 or 2 ckd, it is recommended you have annual egfr tests so the progression of the condition can be carefully monitored. stage 3 is divided into 2: stage 3a (g3a) and 3b (g3b). in stage 3a, the egfr has decreased mildly (45 to 59) and this is termed a mild to moderate decrease in kidney function and should be checked annually. in stage 3b (g3b) it has decreased moderately (30 to 44) and is termed a moderate to severe reduction in kidney function and should be checked every 6 months. stage 4 (g4): the egfr has reduced severely (15 to 29). by this time, it is possible you will be experiencing symptoms of ckd. further testing should be carried out every 6 months. stage 5 (g5): the kidneys have lost almost all of their function (an egfr of below 15), which is known as established\xa0renal failure. further testing should be carried out every 3 months. however, over time, gfr can fluctuate, so one abnormal test result does not automatically mean you have ckd. a diagnosis of ckd is usually only confirmed if repeated egfr tests show your egfr is consistently lower than normal over 3 months.'}, {'other tests': ' other tests are also used to assess the levels of damage to your kidneys:kidney scans, such as an ultrasound scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan or a computerised tomography (ct) scan, are used to find out whether there are any unusual blockages in your urine flow – in cases of advanced kidney disease, the kidneys are shrunken and have an uneven shape kidney biopsy – a small sample of kidney tissue is taken so that the cells can be examined under a microscope for damage'}, {'treating chronic kidney disease': ''}, {'lifestyle changes': ' the

blood pressure is\xa0vital to protect the kidneys. people with ckd should aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmhg but if you also have diabetes you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmhg. there are many types of blood pressure drugs.\xa0medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure in people with ckd. as well as reducing blood pressure around the body and reducing the strain on blood vessels,\xa0ace inhibitors\xa0give additional protection to the kidney. ace inhibitors include:ramipril enalapril lisinopril perindopril side effects of ace inhibitors include:a persistent, dry cough dizziness tiredness or weakness headaches most of these side effects should pass within a few days, although some people continue to have a dry cough. if the side effects of ace inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given an alternative medication called an angiotensin-ii receptor blocker (arb).\xa0this group of medicines includes:candesartan eprosartan irbesartan azilsartan olmesartan temisartan valsartan losartan the side effects of arbs are uncommon, but can include dizziness. both ace inhibitors and arbs can cause a reduction in kidney function in some people\xa0and increased levels of potassium in the blood, so blood tests will need to be performed after you start treatment and whenever the dose changes. if you are on an ace inhibitor or arb and you develop a fever/infection or need medicines for other conditions, it’s important to ask your doctor if the ace inhibitor or arb needs to be temporarily stopped.'}, {'medication to reduce cholesterol': ' studies have shown that people with ckd have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. this is because some of the risk factors for ckd are the same as those for heart attacks and strokes, including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (atherosclerosis). statins are a type of medication used to lower cholesterol levels. cholesterol causes narrowing of the arteries that can lead to a blockage of the blood supply to the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). statins work by blocking the effects of an enzyme in your liver (called hmg-coa reductase), which is used to make cholesterol. statins sometimes have mild side effects, including:constipation diarrhoea headaches abdominal pain occasionally, statins can cause muscle pain, weakness and tenderness. if you experience any of these symptoms, contact your gp. you\xa0may

or dietitian can advise you about this. the excess fluid that occurs as a result of kidney disease often builds up in your ankles or around your lungs. you may also be given diuretics (water tablets), such as furosemide, which will help get rid of the excess fluid from your body. if you do not have any fluid retention and you\xa0have not\xa0been told\xa0to reduce your fluid intake, there is no need to do so.\xa0in fact, it could be harmful in some circumstances.'}, {'anaemia': ' many people with stage three, four and five ckd develop anaemia. anaemia is a condition in which you do not have enough red blood cells. symptoms of anaemia include:tiredness lethargy shortness of breath (dyspnoea) palpitations (awareness of heartbeat) anaemia can occur because of many other conditions and your doctor will investigate to rule out\xa0other possible causes. most people with kidney disease will be given iron supplements because iron is needed for the production of red blood cells. to boost iron levels, iron may be given as tablets, such as daily ferrous sulphate tablets, or as occasional intravenous infusions. if this is not enough to treat anaemia, you may be started on injections of erythropoietin, a hormone which helps your body produce more red blood cells. these injections are often administered into a vein (intravenously)\xa0or under the skin (subcutaneously). examples of these injections include epoetin alfa, beta and zeta, darbepoetin and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.'}, {'correction of phosphate balance': ' if you have stage 4 or 5 kidney disease, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it. phosphate is a mineral that, with calcium, makes up most of your bones. phosphate is obtained through diet, mainly dairy foods. the kidneys usually filter out\xa0excess phosphate. if phosphate levels rise too much, it can upset the normal calcium balance of the body. this can lead to thinning of the bones and furring of the arteries. you may be asked to limit the amount of phosphate in your diet. foods\xa0high in phosphate include red meat, dairy produce, eggs and fish. your gp or dietitian should be able to advise you about how much phosphate you can eat. however, there is no advantage in reducing your intake of these foods unless you have a raised phosphate level.\xa0always ask\xa0a healthcare professional before changing your diet. if reducing the amount of phosphate in your diet does not lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. these medicines bind to the phosphate in the food inside your stomach and stop it from being absorbed into your body. to work properly, phosphate binders must be taken just before meals. the most commonly used phosphate binder\xa0is calcium carbonate, but there\xa0are also alternatives that may be more suitable for\xa0you. the side effects of phosphate binders are uncommon but include:nausea stomach ache constipation diarrhoea flatulence (wind) skin rash itchy skin'}, {'vitamin d supplements': ' people with kidney disease can have low levels of vitamin d, necessary for healthy bones. this is because the kidneys need to activate the vitamin d from food and\xa0the sun before it can be used by the body.'}, {'treatment for kidney failure – transplant or dialysis': ' many people with kidney failure can continue with treatment using medicines and will have good-functioning kidneys for the rest of their lives. in a few people, kidney disease will progress to the stage where the kidneys\xa0stop working and it becomes life threatening. this is called kidney failure or established renal failure (erf). this rarely\xa0happens suddenly, and there will be time to plan the next stage of your condition. the decision whether to have dialysis, a kidney transplant or supportive treatment should be discussed with your healthcare team. read more about dialysis\xa0and\xa0kidney transplants.'}, {'supportive treatment': ' if you decide not to have dialysis or a transplant for kidney failure, or they are not suitable for you,\xa0you will be offered supportive treatment. this is also called palliative care. the aim is to treat and control the symptoms of kidney failure without using dialysis or transplantation. supportive treatment includes medical, psychological and practical care for both the person with kidney failure and their family, including discussion about how you feel and planning for the end of life. many people choose supportive treatment because they:are unlikely to benefit or have quality of life with treatment do not want to go through the inconvenience of treatment with dialysis are advised against dialysis because they have other serious illnesses that will shorten their life, and the negative aspects of treatment outweigh any likely benefits have been on dialysis but have decided to stop this treatment are being treated with

can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. it can be difficult to talk\xa0to people about your condition, even if they are close to you. learning about kidney disease often helps because you and your family will understand more about what to expect and feel more in control of the illness, instead of feeling that your lives are now dominated by kidney disease and its treatment. be open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. however, do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.'}, {'get support': ' your gp or nurse can reassure you if you have questions about your kidney disease, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline

children living at home or if you have a low household income'}, {'sex and pregnancy': ' the symptoms of kidney disease and the stress it causes in your life can affect your sexual relationships. some couples become closer after a diagnosis of kidney disease, while others find that their loved ones are affected by worries about how they will cope with the effects of the illness. both men and women may experience issues about body image and self-esteem, and this can affect the relationship. try to share your feelings with your partner. if you have problems with sex that do not get better with time, speak to a counsellor or sex therapist. people on dialysis often experience specific sexual difficulties. loss of sex drive in both men and women and impotence in men are commonly reported problems. treatment is available, but\xa0it may take some time and requires commitment from both partners. the first step is to discuss it with your healthcare team.'}, {'pregnancy': ' both men and women with early stage kidney disease will find\xa0their fertility is unaffected. this means it is important to use contraception unless you want to have a baby. later stage kidney disease may affect\xa0women’s periods, which can make pregnancy more difficult. for men, later stage kidney disease can cause a reduction in sperm count. however, having kidney disease does not mean you will not get pregnant or be able to father a child, so\xa0both men and women\xa0need to use an effective method of contraception unless they want to have a baby. women who want to have a baby should talk to their renal specialist or an obstetrician with an interest in kidney disease.\xa0depending on the stage of kidney disease, there can be risks to both the mother and the baby. it is important to minimise any risk with a planned pregnancy. your healthcare team can advise you about this.'}, {'holidays and insurance': ' if you have mild kidney disease or you’ve had a transplant, going on holiday shouldn’t pose additional health problems, whether you’re staying in the uk or going abroad. if you’re on dialysis, you can still enjoy holidays provided you book your treatment before you go away. if you’re on dialysis and want to travel, discuss your plans with your renal unit as early as you can. it can sometimes be more difficult to arrange dialysis in the uk than it is abroad. the nhs will look after you if you get ill while on holiday in the uk. if you’re in europe, the european health insurance card (ehic) entitles you to free or reduced-cost hospital treatment. it’s a good idea to take out holiday health insurance in addition to carrying the ehic. anyone with kidney disease should declare it as a pre-existing medical condition on standard insurance application forms. it may exclude you from some policies.'}, {'using over-the-counter medicines': ' some remedies are potentially harmful for people with kidney disease. make sure you check with your doctor before taking a new over the counter medicine. you’re at higher risk of being harmed by certain over the counter remedies if:you have advanced kidney disease (stage 4 or 5, or a kidney function below 30% of normal) you have mild-to-moderate kidney disease (stage 3 with a kidney function between 30 and 60% of normal) and are elderly with another serious illness, such as coronary heart disease'}, {'what’s safe and

kidney failure has a major impact on your life and the lives of those close to you. people diagnosed with kidney failure usually go through shock, grief and denial before they accept their condition.'}, {'choices if you have established renal failure': ' if you have established renal failure (erf), you will need to decide whether to have treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant. you may decide to have neither treatment and to have supportive care. these choices should be made with your healthcare team. for people who want active treatment for their erf, a transplant would be the best option. however, a transplant is only suitable for about half of all people with erf. this is because they may have had recent cancer or\xa0are not physically fit. many people who have slowly progressive kidney failure and other serious health problems, and who are usually older, may choose to avoid dialysis. supportive care can still allow you to live for some time with a good quality of life.'}, {'dialysis': ' dialysis can take place at home or in hospital. it involves filtering the blood of waste products and excess water. it is not as efficient as a human kidney, so people with kidney failure usually need to restrict their intake of fluid and certain foods. they also require additional medicines such as iron supplements, phosphate binders and antihypertensive medicine (to reduce blood pressure). there are 2 types of dialysis: peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.'}, {'peritoneal dialysis': ' the abdomen (tummy) has a lining called the peritoneal membrane, which can be used as a filter to remove excess waste and water. if you have opted for peritoneal dialysis, a tube (catheter) will be inserted into your abdomen during an operation. this will allow you to drain dialysis fluid in and out of your tummy yourself. you will not need to go into hospital to be treated, but you will have to spend an hour or two each day draining the fluid. the treatment involves either four exchanges spaced out during the day, each taking half an hour, or attaching yourself to a machine overnight that pumps the fluid in and out for you.'}, {'haemodialysis': ' haemodialysis removes waste products and excess fluid that build up in the body when the kidneys stop working. blood is taken from the body to be cleaned in a filter known as a dialyser. it is effectively an artificial kidney. the whole process takes about four hours and usually has to be repeated three times a week. most people go into hospital to have haemodialysis. however, some people choose to have the treatment in their own home. home haemodialysis will give you more flexibility, but comes with greater responsibility. you’ll need to have the space in your home for a dedicated machine and, in most cases, a lot of support from a close family member or friend. some people choose to have their dialysis at night while they are asleep. most people who choose home haemodialysis have it every day, so their fluid intake is not as restricted.'}, {'quality vascular access': ' during haemodialysis, it is important that large volumes of blood are passed through the machine. this requires special measures to get into large enough blood vessels. for this reason, haemodialysis patients need a minor operation to join one of the deep arteries to a superficial vein (called a fistula). this is carried out in day surgery and should be done at least 6 weeks before dialysis is required because it needs time to mature before it can be used. occasionally, there will be insufficient time for a fistula to be created before dialysis is required. in this case, a temporary solution is found, usually involving the use of an indwelling plastic dialysis catheter. a catheter is a surgical tube inserted into the body to allow for the transfer of fluid. all the issues will be discussed in detail with you by the dialysis team before any decisions are made.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform':

lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and tends to progress slowly over many years. it mostly affects people over the age of 60 and is rare in people under 40.\xa0children are almost never affected. in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll),\xa0the spongy material found inside some bones (bone marrow)\xa0produces too many white blood cells called lymphocytes that\xa0aren’t fully developed and don’t work properly. over time this can cause a range of problems, such as an increased risk of picking up infections, persistent tiredness,\xa0swollen glands\xa0in the neck, armpits or groin, and unusual bleeding or bruising. cll is different\xa0from other types of leukaemia, including chronic myeloid leukaemia,\xa0acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia.'}, {'symptoms of cll': ' cll doesn’t usually cause any symptoms early on and may only be picked up during a\xa0blood test carried out for another reason. when symptoms develop, they may include:getting infections\xa0often anaemia\xa0– persistent tiredness, shortness of breath and pale skin bleeding and bruising more easily than normal a high temperature (fever) night sweats swollen glands\xa0in your\xa0neck, armpits or groin swelling and discomfort in your tummy unintentional weight loss you should speak to your gp if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. these symptoms can have other causes other than cancer, but it’s a good idea to get them checked out. read more about\xa0diagnosing cll and complications of cll.'}, {'treatments\xa0for cll': ' as cll\xa0progresses slowly and often has no symptoms at first, you may not need to be treated immediately. if it’s caught early on, you’ll have regular check-ups over the following months or years\xa0to see if it’s getting any worse. if cll\xa0starts to cause symptoms, or isn’t diagnosed until later on, the main treatments are:chemotherapy\xa0– where medication\xa0is taken as a tablet or given directly into a vein is used to destroy the cancerous cells a stem cell or bone marrow transplant\xa0– where donated cells called stem cells are transplanted into your body so you start to produce healthy white blood cells treatment can’t\xa0usually cure\xa0cll completely, but can slow its progression and lead to\xa0periods where there are no symptoms. treatment may be repeated if the condition comes back. read more about treating cll.'}, {'outlook for cll': ' the outlook for cll depends on how advanced it is when it’s diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and\xa0your general health. younger, healthier people who are diagnosed when\xa0cll is\xa0still in the early stages generally have the best outlook. although it can’t normally be cured, treatment can help control the condition for many years.'}, {'causes of cll': ' it’s not clear what causes cll. there’s no proven link\xa0with radiation or chemical exposure, diet or infections. you can’t catch it from anyone else or pass it on. however, having certain genes can increase your chances of developing cll. you may be at a slightly higher risk of it if you have a close family member with it, although this risk is still small.'}, {'diagnosing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia': ' most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) are detected during blood tests carried out for another reason. however, you should speak to your gp if you have worrying symptoms of cll, such as\xa0persistent tiredness, unusual bleeding or bruising, unexplained weight loss or night sweats. your gp may:ask about your symptoms and your medical and family history carry out a physical examination to check for problems such as swollen glands and a swollen spleen send off a blood\xa0sample for testing if\xa0your gp\xa0thinks you could have cll, you’ll be referred to a hospital doctor called a haematologist, a specialist in blood disorders, for further tests.'}, {'blood tests': ' the main test used to help diagnose cll is a type of\xa0blood test\xa0called a full blood count. this is where the number and appearance of the different blood cells in a sample of your blood are checked in a laboratory. an abnormally high number of unusual white blood cells\xa0(lymphocytes) can be a sign of\xa0cll. a detailed examination of these cells can usually confirm the diagnosis.'}, {'x-rays and scans': ' you may also have:a chest\xa0x-ray an ultrasound\xa0of your tummy a\xa0computerised tomography (ct) scan these tests can check for problems caused by cll, such as swollen glands\xa0or\xa0a swollen\xa0spleen,\xa0and

so they can\xa0examine it\xa0under a microscope to check it for cancerous cells. the sample is removed\xa0using\xa0a needle inserted into your hip bone. local anaesthetic\xa0is normally used to\xa0numb the area where the needle is inserted, although you may experience some discomfort during the biopsy. the procedure will\xa0last around 15 minutes and you shouldn’t need to stay in hospital overnight. you may\xa0have some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards.'}, {'lymph node biopsy': ' in some cases, removing and examining a swollen lymph gland can help confirm a diagnosis of cll. this is known as a lymph node biopsy. the gland is removed during a minor operation carried out under either local or\xa0general anaesthetic, where you’re asleep. you won’t usually need to stay in hospital overnight. after the operation, you’ll be left with a small wound that will be closed with stitches.'}, {'genetic tests': ' tests may also be carried out on your blood and bone marrow samples to check for any unusual genes in the cancerous cells. identifying unusual genes in these cells can help your doctors decide how soon you should start treatment and which treatment is best for you. some\xa0treatments for cll don’t work as well in people with certain abnormal genes in the affected cells.'}, {'treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia': ' treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) largely depends on what stage the condition is at when it’s diagnosed. you may just need to be monitored at first\xa0if it’s caught early on. chemotherapy is the main treatment if it’s more advanced. treatment can often help keep cll under control for many\xa0years. it\xa0may go away after treatment initially (known as remission), but will usually come back (relapse) a few months or years later and may need to be treated again.'}, {'stages of cll': ' doctors use stages to describe how far cll has developed and help them determine when it needs to be treated. there are 3 main stages of cll:stage a –\xa0you have enlarged lymph\xa0glands in fewer than 3 areas (such as your neck, armpit or groin) and a high white blood cell count stage b –\xa0you have enlarged lymph glands in 3 or more areas and a high white blood cell count stage c –\xa0you have enlarged lymph\xa0glands or an enlarged spleen, a high white blood cell count, and a low red blood cell or platelet count stage b and c cll are usually treated straight away. stage a generally only needs to be treated if it’s getting worse quickly or starting to cause symptoms.'}, {'monitoring early-stage cll': ' treatment may not be needed if you don’t have any symptoms when you’re diagnosed with cll. this is because:cll\xa0often develops very slowly and may not cause symptoms for\xa0many years there’s no benefit in starting treatment early treatment can cause significant side effects in these cases, you will normally just need regular visits to your doctor and\xa0blood tests\xa0to monitor the condition. treatment with chemotherapy will usually only be recommended if you develop symptoms, or tests show that the condition is getting worse.'}, {'chemotherapy for more advanced cll': ' many people with cll will eventually need to have chemotherapy. this involves taking medication to keep the cancer under control. there are a number of different medicines for cll, but most people will take 3 main medications in treatment cycles lasting 28 days. these medicines are:fludarabine –\xa0usually taken as a tablet\xa0for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle cyclophosphamide – also\xa0usually taken as a tablet\xa0for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle rituximab – given\xa0into a vein over the course of\xa0a few hours (intravenous infusion) at the\xa0start of each treatment cycle fludarabine and cyclophosphamide can usually be taken at home. rituximab is given in hospital, and sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight. a number of different medicines can also be tried if you can’t have these medicines, you’ve tried them but they didn’t work, or your cll has come back after treatment. these include bendamustine, chlorambucil, ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab and prednisolone (a steroid medication).'}, {'stem cell or bone marrow transplants': ' stem cell or bone marrow transplants\xa0are sometimes used to try to\xa0get rid of cll completely, or control it for longer periods. stem cells\xa0are cells produced by the spongy material found in the centre of some bones (bone marrow) that can turn into different types of blood cells, including white blood cells. a stem cell transplant involves:having high-dose chemotherapy and\xa0radiotherapy to destroy\xa0the cancerous cells in your body removing stem cells from the blood or bone marrow\xa0of a donor\xa0– this will ideally be someone closely related to you, such as a sibling transplanting the donor stem cells directly into one of your veins this\xa0is the only potential cure for cll,\xa0but it’s not done very often\xa0as it’s an intensive treatment and many people with cll are older and not well enough for the benefits to outweigh the risks. the initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy\xa0can place a significant strain on your body and cause\xa0troublesome side effects. there’s also a risk of serious problems after the transplant, such as graft versus host disease. this is where\xa0the transplanted cells attack the other cells in your body.'}, {'other treatments for cll': ' there are also a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to help treat some of the problems caused by cll, particularly if you can’t have chemotherapy or it doesn’t work. these include:radiotherapy\xa0to\xa0shrink enlarged lymph glands or a swollen spleen surgery to remove a swollen spleen antibiotics,\xa0antifungals and antiviral medications to help reduce your risk of picking up an infection during treatment blood transfusions\xa0to provide more red blood cells and\xa0platelets (clotting\xa0cells)\xa0if you experience severe anaemia or problems with bleeding and bruising immunoglobulin replacement therapy\xa0– a transfusion of\xa0antibodies taken from donated blood that\xa0can help prevent infections injections of medication called\xa0granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) to help boost the number of white blood cells you may also need additional treatment for any complications of cll that develop.'}, {'deciding against treatment': ' as many of the treatments for cll can have unpleasant side effects that may affect your quality of life, you may decide against having a particular type of treatment. this is entirely your decision and your treatment team will respect any decision you make. you won’t be rushed into deciding about your treatment, and before making a decision you can talk to your doctor, partner, family and friends. pain relief and nursing care will still be available as and when you need it.'}, {'complications of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia': ' chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) can sometimes cause a number of further complications.'}, {'infections': ' people with cll usually have a weakened immune system and are more vulnerable to infections\xa0because they have a lack of healthy, infection-fighting white blood cells. treatment with\xa0chemotherapy can also further weaken the immune system. if you have cll, it’s a good idea to:report any possible symptoms of an infection to your gp or care team immediately – things to look out for include a high temperature (fever), aching muscles,\xa0diarrhoea or headaches ensure your vaccinations are up-to-date –\xa0speak to your gp or care team for advice about any additional vaccines you might need, as some aren’t safe if you have a weak immune system avoid close contact with anyone who has an infection – even if it’s an infection to which you were previously immune, such as chickenpox you may also be prescribed regular doses of medications such as antibiotics\xa0to help reduce the risk of infection.'}, {'richter’s syndrome': ' in up to\xa01 in every 20 people with\xa0cll, the condition will change to become very similar to an aggressive form of non-hodgkin lymphoma. this is called richter’s transformation or richter’s syndrome. symptoms of richter’s syndrome include:sudden swelling of your lymph glands a high temperature (fever) night sweats unintentional weight loss tummy (abdominal) pain richter syndrome is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and other powerful medicines. the\xa0cancer research uk website has more information on richter’s syndrome.'}, {'autoimmune haemolytic anaemia': ' around\xa01 in every 10 people with cll will develop a condition called autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. this is where the\xa0immune system\xa0starts to attack and destroy red blood cells. it can cause severe anaemia, making you feel breathless and easily tired. it’s usually treated with steroid medication'}, {'psychological effects': ' being diagnosed with cll can be very distressing and difficult to take in at first, particularly as it can’t necessarily be cured and you may be advised to wait for it to get worse before starting treatment. having to wait years to see how the condition develops can also be very stressful and make you feel anxious or\xa0depressed. speak to your gp or care team if you’re finding it difficult to cope. you may also find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. your gp or care team will\xa0be able to provide you with the details of support groups in your area. macmillan cancer support\xa0provides an excellent level of help and support. their helpline number is\xa00808 808 00 00, monday to friday, 9am to 8pm.'}, {'causes of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia': ' it’s not known what causes most cases of leukaemia. however, there are many risk factors that are known to increase your chances of getting chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia include:having a family history of the condition being of european, american or australian origin having certain medical conditions being male'}, {'family history': ' in some cases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia appears to run in families. it’s thought that an inherited\xa0gene mutation (change to a gene) could increase your susceptibility to developing the condition. this means there may be certain genes in your family that make it more likely that you’ll develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. more research is needed, but having a parent or sibling (brother or sister) with\xa0chronic lymphocytic leukaemia slightly\xa0increases your chances of also developing the condition.'}, {'ethnicity': ' chronic lymphocytic leukaemia most commonly affects people of european, american and australian origin. it’s rare in people from china, japan and south east asia, and it affects more white people than black people. it’s not known why the condition affects people of some ethnic backgrounds and not others.'}, {'other medical conditions': ' research has shown that having certain medical conditions slightly increases your chances of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. these conditions include:pneumonia (chest infection) sinusitis shingles autoimmune haemolytic anaemia long-term (chronic)\xa0osteoarthritis prostatitis (an inflamed prostate) however, rather than causing\xa0chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of these conditions may occur as a result of\xa0having lowered

chronic myeloid leukaemia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/chronic-myeloid-leukaemia/,"[{'about chronic myeloid leukaemia': ' leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer. there are 2 main types:lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage these pages focus on chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is a cancer of the myeloid cells. the following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:chronic lymphocytic leukaemia acute myeloid leukaemia acute lymphoblastic leukaemia'}, {'what happens in chronic leukaemia': ' your bone marrow produces stem cells. these are unique cells because they have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cell:red blood cells – which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells – which help fight infection platelets – which help stop bleeding in leukaemia, a genetic mutation in the stem cells causes a huge over-production of white blood cells and a corresponding drop in red blood cells and platelets. it’s this lack of red blood cells which causes symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and the lack of platelets that increases the risk of excessive bleeding.'}, {'warning signs of chronic myeloid leukaemia': ' in its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms. as the condition develops, symptoms include:tiredness weight loss night sweats a feeling of bloating bruising bone pain read more about the symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia'}, {'how common is chronic myeloid leukaemia?': ' chronic myeloid leukaemia is quite a rare type of cancer. chronic myeloid leukaemia can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people aged 40 to 60. there is no evidence that it runs in families.'}, {'symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia': ' in its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms and it is often diagnosed during tests for a different condition. when symptoms do develop, they are similar to those of many other illnesses and can include:tiredness frequent infections unexplained weight loss a feeling of bloating less commonly, swollen lymph nodes – glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painless chronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). this can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. a swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion. the symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia in its advanced stage will be much more noticeable and troublesome. they include:severe fatigue bone pain night sweats fever easily bruised skin'}, {'causes of chronic myeloid leukaemia': ' chronic myeloid leukaemia is caused by a dna mutation in the stem cells which produce white blood cells. the change in the dna causes the\xa0stem cells to\xa0produce more white blood cells than are needed. they are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature\xa0and able to fight infection like healthy ‘adult’ white blood cells. as the number of immature cells increases,\xa0the number of\xa0healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it’s this\xa0fall\xa0which causes many of the\xa0symptoms of chronic leukaemia.'}, {'philadelphia chromosome': ' although the cause of chronic myeloid leukaemia is genetic, it is not inherited as it is an acquired genetic abnormality. most people with the condition have an abnormal chromosome, where a section of dna from one chromosome\xa0has been swapped with a section from another. this is called the\xa0philadelphia chromosome and it makes the cell produce a protein that encourages the leukaemic cells to resist normal cell death and\xa0grow and multiply far more quickly than usual.'}, {'possible triggers for chronic leukaemia': ' what triggers the development of chronic leukaemia and causes the initial mutation in stem cells is unknown. the one proven risk factor is exposure to radiation. however, radiation is only a significant risk if the levels are extremely high, such as those recorded after an atomic bomb explodes, or those released after a nuclear reactor accident, such as the one at chernobyl.'}, {'diagnosing chronic myeloid leukaemia': ' chronic myeloid leukaemia is often first detected when a routine blood test is carried out to diagnose another, unrelated, condition. a\xa0blood test\xa0that reveals abnormally high levels of white blood cells could be a sign of chronic leukaemia. if you have a blood test with abnormal results, you will be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further testing.'}, {'bone marrow biopsy': ' to confirm a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. this procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy. a bone marrow biopsy is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic. the haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a needle to remove the bone marrow sample.\xa0you\xa0may experience some pain\xa0once the anaesthetic wears off and\xa0some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. the procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you should not have to stay in hospital overnight. the bone marrow sample will be checked to see if there are cancerous cells. if\xa0there are, the biopsy will also be able to help determine which type of chronic leukaemia is present.'}, {'further tests': ' there are a number of additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. these can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated.'}, {'treating chronic myeloid leukaemia': ' imatinib tablets are usually given as soon as you have been diagnosed with\xa0chronic myeloid leukaemia, to slow its progression. these tablets are taken every day for life, and most patients do really well on them. the aim of treatment is to achieve the following:by 3 months, correct the blood count by 12 months, clear the bone marrow of cells containing the philadelphia chromosome (see\xa0causes page for information on this) by 18 months, get to a stage where\xa0the leukaemia can only be detected by a very sensitive molecular test

leukaemia': ''}, {'complications of chronic myeloid leukaemia': ' being immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with chronic leukaemia. there are 2 reasons for this:the lack of healthy white blood cells means your immune system is less able to fight infection many of the medicines used to treat chronic leukaemia\xa0can weaken the immune system this means you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications. you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections from occurring. you should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your gp or\xa0care team\xa0because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications. symptoms of infection include:high temperature (fever) of 38c (101.4f) or above headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness avoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. this is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered). while it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour. also ensure that all of your\xa0vaccinations are up-to-date. your gp or care team will be able to advise you about this. you will be unable to have any vaccine that contains activated particles of viruses or bacteria, such as:the\xa0mumps, measles and rubella (mmr) vaccine the polio vaccine the oral typhoid vaccine the bcg vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis) the yellow fever vaccine'}, {'psychological effects of chronic leukaemia': ' receiving a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. at first, the news may be difficult to take in. the situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of stress, anxiety and depression. if you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition. you may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. your gp or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups. another excellent resource is macmillan cancer support. their helpline number is\xa00808 808 00 00

can cause the following symptoms:bloating indigestion dull abdominal pain if the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for treatment, because they usually disappear on their own. treatment is usually recommended if you’re experiencing symptoms or the pseudocysts are larger than 6cm (2.3 inches) in diameter. larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting open, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection. pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst. this can be done by inserting a needle through your skin and into the cyst. alternatively, an endoscopy\xa0may be used. this is where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid. sometimes, pseudocysts

heart disease. some of these are explained below.'}, {'catheters': ' a catheter, similar to the tube that is used during diagnosis, is inserted into the heart and tools are passed down the catheter to repair the heart defects. the advantage of this type of surgery is that it’s minimally invasive, which means that your child will not have to have open heart surgery.'}, {'open heart surgery': ' for more serious types of heart defects, it may be necessary to operate directly on the heart. during open heart surgery, the heart may be stopped and a machine used to pump blood around your child’s body (bypass machine). an incision is made in your child’s chest so that the heart defects can be surgically repaired, or damaged parts of the heart, such as the valves, can be replaced.'}, {'heart transplant': ' in more serious cases of congenital heart disease, the heart may be too damaged, and the child too ill, for corrective surgery to be safely carried out. in this circumstance, their heart may have to be replaced with a donated heart. if your child requires a heart transplant, their details will be placed on the national transplant database (ntd). depending on the condition of your child’s heart, it may be necessary to keep them in hospital in order to support the function of their heart until a donated heart becomes available. machines, such as the ventricle assist device (vad), act like an external mechanical heart, and can assist in pumping blood around the body. priority for heart transplants is based on clinical need, rather than on a first-come-first-served basis. if your child is in a very unstable condition, they will be prioritised whereas more stable children will have to wait for a longer period of time. once a donated heart of the right size and blood group becomes available, you will be contacted by the transplant team and asked to go to the transplant unit as soon as possible. you may be given a bleeper so that you can be contacted as soon as possible. find out more about heart transplantation on the british heart foundation website.'}, {'treatment for common types of congenital heart disease': ' specific treatments for the most common types of congenital heart disease are described below.'}, {'congenital heart disease in adulthood': ' about 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. living as an adult with congenital heart disease involves a new set of challenges. some adults will require specialised care. routine medical procedures, such as giving birth or having a general anaesthetic, will need to be closely supervised by specialist staff with experience in treating adults with congenital heart disease. there is also the risk that previous heart surgery, such as the insertion of a replacement valve, will fail and that further surgery will be required. due to these factors, it’s recommended that older teenagers register with a specialised adult congenital heart disease clinic. the clinic will be able to provide regular check-ups and assessments, liaise with other specialised medical services as required, and provide on-going support and advice. your gp or treatment team can give you more information about services in your area for adults with congenital heart disease.'}, {'complications of congenital heart disease': ' many children with congenital heart disease will experience delays in their development, and may take longer to reach certain stages in their development, such as walking or talking. some children with congenital heart disease also have associated learning difficulties and require specialised educational and psychological assistance. if your child has congenital heart disease, your local educational authority should draw up an individual education plan (iep). the iep makes an assessment of your child’s current and future needs, and provides access to any specialised services that your child needs, such as speech and language therapy or an educational psychologist. the iep will take into account what level of physical activity is safe for your child. children with congenital heart disease should be encouraged to be as active as possible, but certain activities, such as contact sports, may have to be avoided.'}, {'endocarditis': ' both children and adults with congenital heart disease have an increased risk of developing endocarditis. endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart and, left untreated, it can be life-threatening because it damages the valves of the heart. symptoms of endocarditis include:fever chills sweating (including night sweats) muscular aches and pains chest pain coughs weakness and fatigue headache shortness of breath endocarditis will need to be with injections of antibiotics (intravenous antibiotics). this will involve a hospital stay for several weeks. endocarditis usually develops when an infection in another part of the body, such as on the skin or the gums spreads through the blood into the heart. due to the risk of gum disease leading to endocarditis, it is very important that you have excellent oral hygiene if you have congenital heart disease. it is also usually recommended that you avoid having any cosmetic procedure that involves the piercing of the skin, such tattoos or body piercings.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your

movements, a child with constipation may also have any of the following symptoms:loss of appetite a lack of energy being irritable, angry or unhappy foul-smelling wind and stools stomach\xa0pain and discomfort soiling their clothes generally feeling unwell'}, {'causes of constipation': ' constipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry. most cases of constipation aren’t caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. however, several factors can increase your chances of having constipation, including:not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a

gp for an alternative medicine if appropriate.'}, {'pregnancy': ' about 2\xa0in every 5\xa0women experience constipation during their pregnancy, mostly during the early stages. constipation occurs during pregnancy because your body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant. the bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. this is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. an increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along. if you’re pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. read more about treating constipation.'}, {'other conditions': ' in rare cases, constipation can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) diabetes hypercalcaemia – where there’s too much calcium in the bloodstream

responsible.'}, {'diagnosing constipation': ' constipation is a very common condition. your pharmacist won’t usually need to carry out any tests or procedures, but will confirm a diagnosis based on your symptoms and medical history. your pharmacist will ask you some questions about your bowel habits. don’t feel embarrassed about discussing this with your pharmacist. it’s important they’re aware of all of your symptoms, so they can make the correct diagnosis. your pharmacist may also ask questions about your diet, level of exercise and whether there have been any recent changes to your routines. constipation can be defined in a number of ways:opening the bowels less than 3\xa0times a week needing to strain to open your bowels on more than a quarter of occasions passing a hard or pellet-like stool on more than a quarter of occasions'}, {'physical examination': ' if your pharmacist thinks you may have faecal impaction (when dry, hard stools collect in your rectum), they may advise you to contact your gp for a physical examination. read complications of constipation for more information about faecal impaction. a typical examination will begin with you lying on your back, while the gp feels your abdomen (tummy). you’ll then lie on your side while your gp carries out a rectal examination using a lubricated, gloved finger. your gp will be able to feel for any stools that may have collected. an internal physical examination rarely needs to be carried out on a child. instead, the diagnosis can usually be made by feeling the child’s tummy.'}, {'further tests': ' if you’re experiencing severe symptoms, your doctor may request further tests, such as blood tests or thyroid tests, to diagnose or rule out other conditions. other tests you may have include:an abdominal x-ray\xa0– where x-ray\xa0radiation is used to produce images of the inside of your abdomen transit study examination – where you take a short course of special capsules that show up on x-rays; one or more x-rays are taken later on to see how long it takes for the capsules to pass through your digestive system anorectal manometry – where a small device with a balloon at one end is inserted into your rectum and\xa0attached to a machine that measures pressure readings from the balloon as you squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles; this gives an idea of how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working as there’s an increased risk of bowel cancer in older adults, your doctor may also request tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, including a computerised tomography (ct) scan\xa0or colonoscopy.'}, {'treating constipation': ' treatment for constipation depends on the cause, how long you’ve had it and how severe your symptoms are. in many cases, it’s possible to relieve the symptoms by making dietary and lifestyle changes.'}, {'lifestyle advice': ' changes to diet and lifestyle are often recommended as the first treatment for constipation. in many cases,\xa0this will improve the condition\xa0without the need for medication. some self-help methods of treating constipation are:increase your daily intake of fibre (you should eat at least 18 to 30g of fibre a day) add some bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet to help make your stools softer and easier to pass avoid\xa0dehydration by drinking plenty of water exercise more regularly\xa0– for example,\xa0by going for a daily\xa0walk or run if constipation is causing pain or discomfort, you may want to take a painkiller, such as paracetamol – always follow the dosage instructions carefully; children under 16 shouldn’t take aspirin keep to a routine (a place and time of day) when you’re able to spend time on the toilet and respond to your bowel’s natural pattern: when you feel the urge, don’t delay try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet, so that your knees are above your hips; this can make passing stools easier if medication

may recommend an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don’t help.'}, {'laxatives': ' laxatives\xa0are a type of medicine that help you pass stools. there are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system.'}, {'how long will i need to take laxatives for?': ' if you’ve had constipation for a short time, your pharmacist will usually advise you to stop taking the laxative once your stools are soft and easily passed. however, if your constipation\xa0is caused by\xa0an underlying medical condition or a medicine you’re taking,\xa0your gp may advise you to take laxatives for much longer, possibly many months or\xa0even years. if you’ve been taking laxatives for some time, you may have to gradually reduce your dose, rather than coming off them straight away. if you have been prescribed a combination of laxatives, you’ll normally have to reduce the dosage of each laxative, one at a time, before you can stop taking them. this can take several months. your gp will advise you about when it’s best to stop taking long-term laxatives.'}, {'treating faecal impaction': ' faecal impaction occurs when stools become hard and dry and collect in your rectum. this obstructs the rectum, making it more difficult for stools to pass along. sometimes as a result of impaction, overflow\xa0diarrhoea may occur (where loose stools leak around the obstruction). you may have difficulty controlling this. if you have faecal impaction, you’ll initially be treated with a high dose of the osmotic laxative macrogol. after a few days of using macrogol, you may also have to start taking a stimulant laxative. if you don’t respond to these laxatives, and/or if you have overflow diarrhoea, you may need one of the following medications. suppository – this type of medicine is inserted into your anus. the suppository gradually dissolves at body temperature and is then absorbed into your bloodstream. bisacodyl is an example of a medication that can be given in suppository form. mini enema – where a medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus and into your large bowel. docusate and sodium citrate can be given in this way.'}, {'pregnancy or breastfeeding': ' if you’re pregnant, there are ways for you to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. your pharmacist will first advise you to change your diet by increasing fibre and fluid intake. you’ll also be advised to do gentle exercise. if dietary and lifestyle changes don’t work, you may be prescribed a laxative to help you pass stools more regularly. lots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women to use because most aren’t absorbed by the digestive system. this means that your baby won’t feel the effects of the laxative. laxatives that are safe to use during pregnancy include the osmotic laxatives lactulose and macrogols. if these don’t work, your pharmacist may recommend taking a small dose of bisacodyl or senna (stimulant laxatives). however, senna may not be suitable if you’re in your third trimester of pregnancy, because it’s partially absorbed by your digestive system. read more about constipation and other common pregnancy problems.'}, {'babies\xa0who haven’t been weaned': ' if your baby is constipated but hasn’t started to eat solid foods, the first way to treat them is to give them extra water between their normal feeds. if you’re using formula milk, make the formula as directed by the manufacturer and don’t dilute the mixture. you may want to try gently moving your baby’s legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels.'}, {'babies who are eating solids': ' if your baby is eating solid foods, give them plenty of water or diluted fruit juice. try to encourage them to eat fruit, which can be puréed or chopped, depending on their ability to chew. the best fruits for babies to eat to treat constipation are:apples apricots grapes peaches pears plums prunes raspberries strawberries never force your baby to eat food if they don’t want to. if you do, it can turn mealtimes into a battle and your child may start to think of eating as a negative and stressful experience. if your baby is still constipated after a change in diet, they may have to be prescribed a laxative. bulk-forming laxatives aren’t suitable for babies, so they’ll usually be given an osmotic laxative. however, if this doesn’t work, they can be prescribed a stimulant laxative.'}, {'children': ' for\xa0children, laxatives are often recommended alongside changes to diet. osmotic laxatives are usually tried first, followed by a stimulant laxative if necessary. as well as eating fruit, older children should have a healthy, balanced diet, which also contains vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta. try to minimise stress or conflict associated with meal times or\xa0using the toilet. it’s important to be positive and encouraging when it comes to establishing a toilet routine. allow your child\xa0at least 10 minutes on the toilet, to make sure they’ve passed as many stools as possible. to encourage a positive toilet routine, try making a diary of your child’s bowel movements linked to a reward system. this can help them focus on using the toilet successfully.'}, {'complications of constipation': ' constipation rarely causes any complications or long-term health problems. treatment is usually effective, particularly if it’s started promptly. however, if you have long-term (chronic) constipation, you may be more at risk of experiencing complications.'}, {'rectal bleeding': ' continually straining to pass stools can cause pain, discomfort and rectal bleeding. in some cases, bleeding is the result of a small tear around the anus (anal fissure), but it’s more often caused by\xa0haemorrhoids (piles). piles are swollen blood vessels that form in the lower rectum and anus. as well as bleeding, piles can also cause pain, itching around the anus, and swelling of the anus. the\xa0symptoms of piles often settle down after a few days without treatment. however, creams and ointments are available to reduce any itching or discomfort. see your pharmacist as soon as possible if you experience any rectal bleeding.'}, {'faecal impaction': ' long-term constipation can increase the risk of faecal impaction, which\xa0is where dried, hard stools collect in your rectum and anus. once you have faecal impaction, it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to get rid of the stools naturally. faecal impaction makes constipation worse because it’s harder for stools and waste products to pass out of your anus, as the path is obstructed. faecal impaction can sometimes lead to a number of other complications, including:swelling of the rectum a loss of sensation in and around your anus bowel\xa0incontinence bleeding from your anus rectal prolapse\xa0– where part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your anus (this can also occur\xa0as a result of\xa0repeated straining in people with\xa0chronic constipation) faecal impaction is usually treated with laxative medication, although suppositories (medication inserted into the anus) and\xa0mini enemas (where medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus) may sometimes be used.'}, {'preventing constipation': ' there are a number of things you can do to prevent constipation, including making diet and lifestyle changes.'}, {'fibre': ' including\xa0enough fibre in your diet can significantly reduce your chances of developing constipation. most adults don’t eat enough fibre. you should aim to have about 30g of fibre a day. you can increase your fibre intake by eating more:fruit and vegetables wholegrain rice wholewheat pasta wholemeal bread seeds and oats eating more fibre will keep your bowel movements regular, because it helps food pass through your digestive system more easily. foods high in fibre also make you feel fuller for longer. it’s important to increase your fibre intake gradually, because a sudden increase may make you feel bloated. suddenly increasing your intake of fibre may also cause you to produce more wind\xa0(flatulence) and experience stomach cramps. read more about\xa0how to increase your intake of fibre and eating a healthy, balanced diet.'}, {'fluids': ' make sure you drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, and steadily increase your intake when exercising or when it’s hot. try to cut back on the amount of caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks you consume.'}, {'toilet habits': ' never ignore the urge to go to the toilet, because it can significantly increase your chances of having constipation. when going to the toilet, make sure you have enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably.'}, {'exercise': ' keeping active and\xa0mobile will greatly reduce your risk of getting constipation. you should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week. as well as regular exercise

few days feeling sad or unhappy. depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time. while some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it’s actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. it impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. studies show that around 4% of children in the uk between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious. with the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.'}, {'do i have depression?': ' depression has a range of different symptoms, and it can affect everybody differently. the symptoms include feeling very tearful, feeling hopelessness and sadness, and losing interest in things you enjoyed before. it’s also common for people with depression to have symptoms of anxiety. physical symptoms happen with depression too – these can include feeling tired all the time, getting poor sleep, losing your sex drive, losing your appetite, and feeling aches and pains. if the symptoms are mild, you might simply experience a persistent low mood. it’s common to feel stressed, sad or anxious during difficult times in your life, and a low mood can get better after a short time, rather than being a symptom of depression. severe symptoms of depression can make people feel suicidal – as if life is no longer worth living. read more about depression symptoms here.'}, {'seeing a doctor about depression': ' big changes in your life, like bereavement, losing a job, or even having a baby, can cause symptoms of depression. you’re also more likely to experience depression if you have a family history of depression. however, it’s also possible to become depressed without there being an obvious reason. you can learn more about depression causes here.'}, {'\u200bsymptoms and causes of depression': ' symptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. however, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy. depression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months. doctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is:mild depression – it has some impact on daily life moderate depression – it has a significant impact on your daily life severe depression – this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day a few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychotic depression. below is a list of depression symptoms – it’s unlikely that one person would have all of them.'}, {'depression and grief': ' depression and grief have a lot of the same features, and it can be hard to tell them apart. however, they’re different in many important ways. depression is an illness – grief is a completely natural response to loss. if you’re grieving, you may find your feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but it’s still possible to enjoy things in life and look forward to the future. people with depression feel sad persistently, find it difficult to be positive about the future, and don’t get enjoyment from anything.'}, {'different types of depression': ' there are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. these conditions include:bipolar disorder – people with bipolar disorder, which is also known as “manic depression”, experience times of depression, where the symptoms are similar to clinical depression. they also go through phases when they have excessively high moods (known as “mania”). bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour like unsafe sex, spending sprees and gambling. seasonal affective disorder (sad) is also called “winter depression”. it’s depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally. postnatal depression happens to some women after they’ve had a baby. it’s treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy. learn more about how depression is diagnosed here.'}, {'causes of depression': ' depression doesn’t have one single cause – it can have a range of triggers, and there are many different reasons a person can develop the condition. some people are affected after a stressful life event, like a bereavement or divorce. other people experience depression related to illness, job loss, or money worries. different reasons can combine and trigger depression. if you’re feeling low after a job loss or health issues, and then experience something traumatic, like a bereavement, you can develop depression. it’s common to hear about depression being brought on by a “downward spiral” – one thing causing other problems that combine to cause depression. for example, losing your job could make you feel sad, so you spend less time with family and friends and maybe drink more alcohol. these things all make you feel worse, which triggers depression. there are studies that suggest people are more likely to become depressed when they get older. there’s also evidence that depression is more common for people whose economic and social circumstances are difficult.'}, {'\u200bdiagnosing and treating depression': ' there’s no physical test for depression. if you experience depression symptoms most of the day, every day, for more than two weeks, you should visit your gp. this is especially important if:you have symptoms of depression that aren’t getting any better you have thoughts of self-harm or suicide your work, relationships with friends and family, or interests are affected by your mood it can be hard for people with depression to imagine that anything can help them – but the sooner you seek help, the sooner the symptoms start to get better. your gp may examine you and perform blood or urine tests to make sure there isn’t another condition causing your depression symptoms, like an underactive thyroid. when you see your gp, they’ll try to find out if you have depression by asking you questions. these are likely to be about your health, how you’re feeling, and how that is affecting you mentally and physically. telling your doctor your symptoms and the affect they are having on you will help your gp to tell if you have depression, and how severe the condition is. it’s important to be as open as possible. your conversation with your gp will be confidential. this rule can only be broken if your gp thinks there is a significant risk of harm to you or others, and that telling a family member or carer would make that risk lower.'}, {'treating depression': ' the first place to go is your gp – they will refer to you local talking treatments for depression that are available on the nhs. you may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you’d rather not talk to your gp.'}, {'talking treatments for depression': ' there are a number of talking therapies for depression.'}, {'antidepressants': ' antidepressants are medicines that treat depression symptoms. there are almost 30 different types of antidepressant that can be prescribed to you. most people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants, but this isn’t the case for everyone. one type of antidepressant might not work for you, but another one could. it can take two or more different treatments to find the right one for you. side effects vary between different people and different antidepressants, but the different types of antidepressant all work around as well as each other. if you’re prescribed antidepressants, you should see your gp or specialist nurse regularly while you first start taking the medication – every week or two for at least four weeks. this is so your treatment provider can see how the antidepressants are working. if the medication is working for you, you should continue taking them at the same dose for at least four to six months after the depression symptoms have eased. people who have had depression in the past might have to take antidepressants for up to five years, maybe longer. antidepressants aren’t addictive. however, you might have withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. you can read more about withdrawal symptoms below.'}, {'other treatments for depression': ' there is a range of other treatments that people are given for depression.'}, {'\u200bliving

able to change to shorter hours, or work more flexibly. this is especially true if pressure at work causes you to experience depression symptoms. the equality act means that employers need to make reasonable adjustments to make it possible to employ people with disabilities – this can include people who have been diagnosed with depression and other mental health conditions. you can find more

affect you too. your relationship, and family life in general, can be strained, and you might not know what to do or how to help. talking about the situation can help. finding a support group, or talking to other people in a similar situation, can make it easier to cope. if the condition is causing difficulties in your relationship with your partner, you could contact a relationship counsellor

hearing, seeing or sometimes smelling, feeling or tasting things that aren’t there. hearing voices is a common type of hallucination. hallucinations and delusions almost always reflect the deeply depressed mood of the person experiencing them. they may believe they have committed a crime or that they are to blame for something. people with psychosis also commonly experience something called psychomotor agitation. people experiencing this cannot sit still or relax, and fidget all the time. the opposite symptom can also happen – psychomotor retardation can cause a person’s thoughts and the

in managing skin conditions) if they are unsure of the diagnosis or if you need patch testing. your gp or specialist can recommend suitable treatments.'}, {'what causes discoid eczema?': ' the cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it is often accompanied by dry skin and is thought\xa0to be triggered by irritation of the skin. discoid eczema\xa0tends to affect adults and is rare in

{'symptoms of discoid eczema': ' discoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema. the patches can appear anywhere on the body, including the:lower legs forearms trunk (torso) hands feet the face and scalp are not\xa0normally affected. the\xa0first sign of discoid eczema is\xa0usually a group of small red spots or bumps on the skin. these then quickly join up to form larger\xa0pink, red or brown patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size. initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. they also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night. over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky.\xa0the centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of\xa0discoloured skin that can be mistaken for\xa0ringworm. you may just have one patch of discoid eczema, but most people have several patches. the skin between the patches\xa0is

take antibiotics tablets. read more about diagnosing discoid eczema.'}, {'causes of discoid eczema': ' the cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may occur as a result of having particularly dry skin. dry skin means your skin cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it, which could allow\xa0a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate (damage) your skin. it’s important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. contact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may therefore have a role in discoid eczema. some people with discoid eczema also have a history of\xa0atopic eczema, which often occurs in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever. however, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families.'}, {'other possible triggers': ' an outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an\xa0insect bite or a burn. some medicines may also be associated with discoid eczema, as patches of eczema can appear in people

lukewarm baths or showers – using an emollient when washing may reduce your symptoms, and remember to apply your treatments soon afterwards not scratching the patches – keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short may help reduce the risk of skin damage or infection from unintentional scratching making sure you use and apply your treatments as instructed by your gp or pharmacist if you suspect your skin is infected, for example because there is excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema, see your gp. infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection.'}, {'emollients': ' emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. they are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.'}, {'topical corticosteroids': ' to treat the patches of discoid eczema, your gp may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin) to reduce the inflammation. you may be concerned about using medication that contains steroids. however, corticosteroids are not the

eczema.'}, {'corticosteroid tablets': ' if you have a severe flare-up, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid tablets to take for up to a week. if corticosteroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as:reduced growth rate in children high blood pressure (hypertension) osteoporosis (brittle bones) diabetes for this reason, your doctor is

symptom of itching, particularly if it is interfering with your sleep. however, they will not treat the damaged skin. many older types of antihistamines can make you drowsy, which can be useful if your symptoms affect the quality of your sleep. otherwise, ask your pharmacist or gp to recommend one of the more modern “non-sedating” antihistamines.'}, {'further treatments': ' if the treatments

diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women. overall, symptoms of diverticulitis are most likely to occur in people over 70 years old. diverticular disease is often described as a ‘western disease’ because the rates are high in european and north american countries, and low in african and asian countries. a combination of genetics and diet is thought to be the reason for this and the fact that people in western countries tend to\xa0eat less fibre. people aged 50 to 70 who eat a high-fibre diet (25g a day) have a 40% lower chance of admission to hospital with complications of diverticular disease – compared to others in their age range with the lowest amount of dietary fibre.'}, {'symptoms of diverticular disease

that a high-fibre diet is likely to reduce the risk of any symptoms developing.'}, {'diverticular disease': ' the most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side. the pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. passing stools and breaking wind (flatulence) may help\xa0relieve the pain. other long-term symptoms of diverticular disease include:a change in your normal bowel habits, such as\xa0constipation or diarrhoea, or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea – a classic pattern is multiple trips to the toilet in the morning to pass stools like ‘rabbit pellets’ bloating another possible symptom of diverticular disease is\xa0bleeding dark purple blood from your rectum (back passage). this usually occurs after diarrhoea-like cramping pain, and often leads to hospital admission, but fortunately this is\xa0an uncommon complication. diverticular disease does not cause weight loss, so if you are losing weight, seeing blood in your stools or experiencing frequent bowel changes, see your gp.'}, {'diverticulitis': ' diverticulitis shares\xa0most of the symptoms of diverticular disease (see above). however, the\xa0pain associated with diverticulitis is constant and severe, rather than intermittent. it is most likely to occur if you have previously had symptoms of diverticular disease, and develops over a day or 2. other symptoms of diverticulitis can include:a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above a general feeling of being tired and unwell feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) the pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen. in asian people, the pain may move

they can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as:a stomach ulcer pancreatitis cholecystitis bowel cancer irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) can also cause similar symptoms to diverticular disease.'}, {'causes of diverticular disease and diverticulitis': ' diverticular disease is caused by small bulges in the large intestine (diverticula) developing and becoming inflamed. if any of the diverticula become infected, this leads to symptoms of diverticulitis. the exact reason why diverticula develop is not known, but\xa0they\xa0are associated with not eating enough fibre. fibre makes your stools softer and larger, so less pressure is needed by your large intestine to push them out of your body. the pressure of moving hard, small pieces of stools through your\xa0large intestine creates weak spots in the outside layer of muscle. this allows the inner layer (mucosa)\xa0to squeeze through these weak spots, creating the diverticula. there is currently no clinical evidence to fully prove the link between fibre and diverticula. however, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are both much more common in western countries, where many people do not eat enough fibre.'}, {'diverticular disease': ' it is not known why only 1\xa0in 4\xa0people with diverticula go on to have symptoms of diverticulitis. diverticular disease may be chronic low-level diverticulitis. the

overweight or obese having a history of constipation use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)\xa0painkillers, such as\xa0ibuprofen or naproxen having a close relative with diverticular disease, especially if they developed it under the age of 50 exactly how these lead to developing diverticular disease is unclear.'}, {'diverticulitis': ' diverticulitis is caused by an infection of one or more of the diverticula. it is thought an infection develops when a hard piece of stool or undigested food\xa0gets trapped in one of the pouches. this gives bacteria in the stool the chance to multiply and spread, triggering an infection.'}, {'diagnosing diverticular disease and diverticulitis': ' diverticular disease can be difficult to diagnose from the symptoms, alone because there are other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). as a first step, your gp may recommend\xa0blood tests to rule out other conditions such as\xa0coeliac disease (a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten) or bowel cancer. in some cases, you may be offered treatment for ibs and diverticular disease at the same time.'}, {'diverticulitis': ' if you have had a previous history of diverticular disease, your gp will usually be able to diagnose diverticulitis from your symptoms and a\xa0physical examination. a blood test may be taken, because a high number of white blood cells indicates infection. if your symptoms are mild, your gp will treat it at home and you should recover within 4\xa0days. further tests will be needed if you have no previous history of diverticular disease. if you are unwell, your gp may refer you to hospital for blood tests and investigations. this is to look for complications of diverticulitis and to rule out other possible conditions, such as gallstones or a hernia. an\xa0ultrasound scan may be used, as well as a ct scan. a ct scan may also be used if your symptoms are particularly severe. this is to check whether a complication, such as a perforation or an\xa0abscess, has occurred.'}, {'treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis': ' treatment options for diverticular disease and diverticulitis depend on how severe your symptoms are.'}, {'diverticular disease': ' most cases of diverticular disease can be treated at home. the over-the-counter painkiller paracetamol is recommended to help relieve your symptoms. painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are not recommended because they may upset your stomach and increase your risk of internal bleeding. eating a high-fibre diet may initially help to control your symptoms. some people will notice an improvement after a few days, although it can take around a month\xa0to feel the benefits fully. read more advice about using diet to improve the symptoms of\xa0diverticular disease. if you\xa0have constipation, you may be given a bulk-forming laxative. these can cause flatulence (wind) and bloating. drink plenty of fluids to prevent any obstruction in your digestive system. heavy or constant rectal bleeding occurs in about 1 in\xa020 cases of diverticular disease. this can happen if the blood vessels in your large intestine (colon) are weakened by the diverticula, making them vulnerable to damage. the bleeding is usually painless, but losing too much blood can be potentially serious and may need a blood transfusion. signs that you may be experiencing heavy bleeding (aside from the amount of blood) include:feeling very dizzy mental confusion pale clammy skin shortness of breath if you suspect that you (or someone in your care) is experiencing heavy bleeding, seek immediate medical advice. contact your gp at once. if this is not

2\xa0episodes of diverticulitis as a precaution to prevent complications. this is no longer the case, as studies have found that in most cases, risks of serious complications from surgery (estimated to be around 1 in 100) usually outweigh the benefits. however, there are exceptions to this, such as:if you have a history of serious complications arising from diverticulitis if you have\xa0symptoms of diverticular disease from\xa0a young age (it is thought the longer you live with diverticular disease, the greater your chances of having a serious complication) if you have a weakened immune system or are more vulnerable to\xa0infections if surgery is being considered, discuss both\xa0benefits and risks carefully with the doctor in charge of your care. in rare cases, a severe episode of

as:pain when urinating (dysuria) needing to urinate more often than usual in rare cases, air in the urine'}, {'abscess': ' the most common complication of diverticulitis is an abscess outside the large intestine (colon). an abscess is a pus-filled cavity or lump in the tissue. abscesses are usually treated with a technique known as percutaneous abscess drainage (pad). a radiologist (a specialist in the use of imaging equipment, such as computerised tomography (ct) scans) uses an ultrasound or ct scanner to locate the site of the abscess. a fine needle connected to a small tube is passed through the skin of your abdomen (stomach) and into the abscess. the tube is then used to drain the pus from the abscess. a pad is performed under a local anaesthetic. depending on the size of the abscess, the procedure may need repeating several times before all\xa0the pus has been drained. if the abscess is very small – usually less than 4cm (1.5 inches) – it may be possible to treat it using antibiotics.'}, {'fistula': ' a\xa0fistula is another\xa0common complication of diverticulitis. fistulas are abnormal tunnels that connect 2\xa0parts of the body together, such as your intestine and your abdominal wall or bladder. if infected tissues come into contact with each other, they can stick together. after the tissues have healed, a fistula may form. fistulas can be potentially serious as they can allow bacteria in your large intestine to travel to other parts of your body, triggering infections, such as an infection of the bladder (cystitis). fistulas are usually treated with surgery to remove the section of the colon that contains the fistula.'}, {'peritonitis': ' in rare cases, an infected diverticulum (pouch in your colon) can split, spreading the infection into the lining of your abdomen (perforation). an infection of the lining of the abdomen is known as peritonitis. peritonitis can be life-threatening, and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. surgery may also be required to\xa0drain any pus that has built up, and it may be necessary to perform a colostomy.'}, {'intestinal obstruction': ' if the infection has badly scarred your\xa0large intestine, it may become partially or totally blocked. a totally blocked\xa0large intestine is a medical emergency because the tissue of your\xa0large intestine will start to decay and eventually

intracavernosal injection a small pellet placed inside your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the tip of your penis)\xa0– this is called urethral application you may be trained to correctly inject or insert alprostadil. if your partner is pregnant,\xa0use a condom during sex if you are inserting alprostadil into your urethra. alprostadil will usually produce an erection after five to 15 minutes. how long the erection lasts will depend on the dose. in men who did not respond to pde-5 inhibitors, alprostadil injections were successful in 85 out of 100 men. alprostadil inserted into the urethra is successful for up to two-thirds of men.'}, {'hormone therapy': ' if a hormonal condition is causing\xa0erectile dysfunction, you may be referred to an endocrinologist (who

normal hormone levels.'}, {'surgery': ' surgery for\xa0erectile dysfunction is usually only recommended if all other treatment methods have failed. it may also be considered in:younger men who have experienced serious injury to their pelvic area\xa0– for example, in a car accident men with a significant anatomical problem with their penis in the past, surgery was used if there was clear evidence of a blockage to the blood supply of the penis. the surgeon could unblock the blood vessels to restore a normal supply of blood. however, research now suggests that the long-term results of this type of surgery are poor, so it’s unlikely to be used.'}, {'psychological treatments': ' if your\xa0erectile dysfunction has an underlying psychological cause then you may benefit from a type of treatment called sensate focus. if conditions such as anxiety or depression are causing your\xa0erectile dysfunction, you may benefit from\xa0counselling\xa0(a talking therapy).'}, {'pelvic floor muscle exercises': ' some studies have suggested that, in a few cases, it may be beneficial to exercise your pelvic floor muscles. these are a group of muscles around the underside of the bladder and rectum, as well as at the base of the penis. pelvic floor muscle exercise involves strengthening and training the muscles used to control the anus (back passage) and urinate. if your gp feels this type of exercise could be beneficial, then you may want to discuss it with a physiotherapist to learn it correctly. by strengthening and training\xa0these muscles, you may be able to reduce the symptoms of\xa0erectile dysfunction.'}, {'complementary therapies': ' some complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, have claimed to treat erectile dysfunction. however, there is little evidence they are

food allergy,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/food-allergy/,"[{'about food allergies': ' a food allergy is when the body’s immune system reacts unusually to specific foods. although allergic reactions are often mild, they can be very serious. symptoms of a food allergy can affect different areas of the body at the same time. some common symptoms include:an itchy sensation inside the mouth, throat or ears a raised itchy red rash (urticaria,\xa0or “hives”) swelling of the face, around the eyes, lips, tongue and roof of the mouth\xa0(angioedema) vomiting read more about the\xa0symptoms of food allergies'}, {'anaphylaxis': ' in the most serious cases, a person\xa0has a\xa0severe allergic reaction\xa0(anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening. if you think someone has the\xa0symptoms of anaphylaxis\xa0–\xa0such as breathing difficulties, lightheadedness, and feeling like they’re going to faint or lose consciousness\xa0–\xa0call 999. ask for an ambulance and tell the operator you think the person has anaphylaxis or “anaphylactic shock”.'}, {'what causes food allergies?': ' food allergies happen when the immune system\xa0– the body’s defence against infection\xa0– mistakenly treats proteins found in food as a threat. as a result, a number of chemicals are released. it’s these chemicals that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. almost any food can cause an allergic reaction, but there are certain foods that are responsible for\xa0most food allergies. in children, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are:milk eggs peanuts tree nuts fish shellfish most children that have a food allergy will have experienced\xa0eczema\xa0during infancy. the worse the child’s eczema and the earlier it started, the more likely\xa0they are to have a food allergy. in adults, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are:peanuts tree nuts\xa0–\xa0such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and hazelnuts fruits\xa0– such as apples and peaches fish shellfish –\xa0such as crab, lobster and prawns it’s still unknown why people develop allergies to food, although they often have other allergic conditions, such as\xa0asthma,\xa0hay fever\xa0and eczema. read more information about the\xa0causes and risk factors for food allergies'}, {'types of food allergies': ' food allergies are divided into three types, depending on symptoms and when they occur.ige-mediated food allergy\xa0–\xa0the most common type, triggered by the immune system producing an antibody called immunoglobulin e (ige). symptoms occur\xa0a few seconds or minutes after eating. there’s a greater risk of anaphylaxis with this type of allergy. non-ige-mediated food allergy\xa0–\xa0these allergic reactions aren’t caused by immunoglobulin e, but by other cells in the immune system. this type of allergy is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms take much longer to develop (up to several hours). mixed ige and non-ige-mediated food allergies\xa0–\xa0some people may experience symptoms from both types. read more information about the\xa0symptoms of a food allergy'}, {'treatment': ' the best way of preventing an allergic reaction is to identify the food that causes the allergy and avoid it. research is currently looking at ways to desensitise some food allergens, such as peanuts and milk, but this is not an established treatment. read more about\xa0identifying foods that cause allergies (allergens) avoid making any radical changes,\xa0such as cutting out dairy products,\xa0to your or your child’s diet without first talking to your gp. for some foods, such as milk, you may need to speak to a dietitian before making any changes. a type of medication called an\xa0antihistamine\xa0can help relieve the symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction. a higher dose of antihistamine is often needed to control acute allergic symptoms. adrenaline is an effective treatment for more severe allergic symptoms, such as\xa0anaphylaxis. people with a food allergy are often given a device known as an auto-injector pen, which contains doses of adrenaline that can be used in emergencies. read more about the\xa0treatment of food allergies'}, {'who’s affected?': ' most food allergies affect younger children under the age of three. it’s estimated around\xa01 in every 14 children of this age has at least one food allergy. most children\xa0who have\xa0food allergies to milk, eggs, soya and wheat in early life will grow out of it by the time they start school. peanut and tree nut allergies are usually more persistent. an estimated four out of\xa0five children with peanut allergies remain allergic to peanuts for the rest of their lives. food allergies that develop during adulthood, or persist into adulthood, are likely to be lifelong allergies. for reasons that are unclear, rates of food allergies have risen sharply in the last\xa020 years. however, deaths from anaphylaxis-related food reactions are now rare.'}, {'symptoms of a food allergy': ' the symptoms of a food allergy\xa0almost always develop a\xa0few seconds or minutes after eating the food. some people may develop a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening. the\xa0most common type of\xa0allergic reaction to food is known as an ige-mediated food allergy. symptoms include:tingling or itching in the mouth a raised, itchy red rash (urticarial) – in some cases, the skin can turn red and itchy, but without a raised rash swelling of the face, mouth\xa0(angioedema), throat\xa0or other areas of the body difficulty swallowing wheezing or shortness of breath feeling\xa0dizzy and lightheaded feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting abdominal pain or\xa0diarrhoea hay fever-like symptoms, such as sneezing or itchy eyes\xa0(allergic conjunctivitus)'}, {'anaphylaxis': ' the symptoms of a severe allergic reaction\xa0(anaphylaxis)\xa0can be sudden and get worse very quickly. initial\xa0symptoms of anaphylaxis\xa0are often the same as those listed above and can lead to:increased breathing difficulties\xa0–\xa0such as wheezing and a cough a sudden and intense feeling of anxiety and fear a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) a sharp and sudden drop in your blood pressure, which can make you feel lightheaded and confused unconsciousness anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. without quick treatment, it can be life threatening. if you think you or someone you know is experiencing anaphylaxis, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible.'}, {'non-ige-mediated food allergy': ' another type of\xa0allergic reaction is a non-ige-mediated food allergy. the symptoms of this type of allergy can\xa0take much longer to develop\xa0– sometimes\xa0up to several days. some symptoms of a non ige-mediated food allergy\xa0may be what you would expect to see in an allergic reaction, such as:redness and itchiness of the skin\xa0–\xa0although not a raised, itchy red rash\xa0(urticarial) the skin becomes itchy, red, dry and cracked\xa0(atopic eczema) other symptoms can be much less obvious and are sometimes thought of as being caused by something other than an allergy. they include:heartburn and indigestion caused by stomach acid leaking up out of the stomach\xa0(gastro-oesophageal reflux disease) stools (faeces)\xa0becoming much more frequent or loose\xa0– though not necessarily diarrhoea blood and mucus in the stools in babies\xa0–\xa0excessive and inconsolable crying, even though the baby is well fed and doesn’t need a nappy change (colic) constipation redness around the anus, rectum and genitals unusually pale skin failure to grow at the expected rate'}, {'mixed reaction': ' some children can have a mixed reaction where they experience both ige symptoms, such as swelling, and non-ige symptoms, such as constipation. this can happen to children who have a milk allergy.'}, {'causes of a food allergy': ' a food allergy is caused\xa0by your immune system handling harmless proteins in certain foods as a threat. it releases a number of chemicals, which trigger an allergic reaction.'}, {'the immune system': ' the immune system protects the body by producing specialised proteins called antibodies. antibodies identify potential threats to your body, such as bacteria and viruses. they signal your immune system to release chemicals to kill the threat and prevent the spread of infection. in the most common type of food allergy, an antibody known as immunoglobulin e (ige) mistakenly targets a certain protein found in food as a threat. ige can cause\xa0several chemicals to be released, the most important being histamine.'}, {'non-ige-mediated food allergy': ' there’s another type of food allergy known as a non-ige-mediated food allergy, caused by different cells in the immune system. this is much harder to diagnose as there’s no test to accurately confirm non-ige-mediated food allergy. this type of reaction is largely confined to the skin and digestive system, causing symptoms such as heartburn, indigestion and eczema. in babies, a\xa0non-ige-mediated food allergy can also cause diarrhoea and reflux, where stomach acid leaks up into the throat.'}, {'foods': ' in children, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are:eggs milk\xa0–\xa0if a child has an allergy to cow’s milk, they’re probably allergic to all types of milk, as well as infants’ and follow-on formula soya wheat peanuts in adults, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are:peanuts tree nuts\xa0–\xa0such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and pistachios fish shellfish\xa0– such as crab, lobster and prawns however, any type of food can potentially cause an allergy. allergic reactions have been reported in association with:celery or celeriac\xa0–\xa0this can sometimes cause anaphylactic shock gluten\xa0–\xa0a type of protein found in cereals mustard sesame seeds fruit and vegetables\xa0–\xa0these usually only cause symptoms affecting the mouth, lips and throat (oral allergy syndrome) pine nuts (a type of seed) meat\xa0–\xa0some people are allergic to just one type of meat, while others are allergic to a range of meats; a common symptom is skin irritation'}, {'who’s at risk?': ' exactly what causes the immune system to mistake harmless proteins as a threat is unclear. however, a number of risk factors for food allergies have been identified, which are outlined below.'}, {'the rise in food allergy cases': ' the number of people with food allergies has risen sharply over the past few decades and,\xa0although the reason is unclear, other allergic conditions such as atopic dermatitis have also increased. one theory behind the rise is that a typical child’s diet has changed considerably over the last 30 to 40 years. another theory is that children are increasingly growing up in “germ-free” environments. this means their immune systems may not receive sufficient early exposure to the germs needed to develop properly. this is known as the hygiene hypothesis.'}, {'food additives': ' it’s rare for someone to\xa0have an\xa0allergic\xa0reaction to food additives. however,\xa0certain additives\xa0may cause\xa0a flare-up of symptoms in people with pre-existing\xa0conditions.'}, {'diagnosing food allergy': ' if you think you or your child has a food allergy, make an appointment with your gp. they\xa0will ask you\xa0some questions about the pattern of your child’s symptoms, such as:how long did it take for the symptoms to start after exposure to the food? how long did the symptoms last? how severe were the symptoms? is this the first time these symptoms have occurred? if not, how often have they\xa0occurred? what food was involved and how much of it did your child eat? they’ll also want to know about your child’s medical history, such as:do they have any other allergies or allergic conditions? is there a history of allergies in the family? was (or is) your child breastfed or bottle-fed? your gp may also assess your child’s weight and size to make sure they’re growing at the expected rate.'}, {'referral to an allergy clinic': ' if your gp suspects a food allergy, you may be referred to an allergy clinic or centre for testing. the tests needed can vary, depending on the type of allergy:if the symptoms\xa0developed quickly (an ige-mediated food allergy)\xa0–\xa0you’ll probably be given a skin-prick test or a\xa0blood test if the symptoms developed more slowly (non-ige-mediated food allergy)\xa0–\xa0you’ll probably be put on a food elimination diet there is more information on these tests below.'}, {'skin-prick testing': ' during\xa0a skin-prick test, drops of\xa0standardised extracts\xa0of\xa0foods are placed on the arm. the skin is then pierced with a small\xa0lancet, which allows the allergen to come into contact with the\xa0cells of your immune system. occasionally, your doctor may\xa0perform the\xa0test using a sample of the food thought to cause a reaction. itching, redness and swelling usually indicates a positive reaction. this test is usually painless. a skin-prick test does have a small theoretical chance of causing anaphylaxis, but testing will be carried out where there are facilities to deal with\xa0this\xa0–\xa0usually an allergy clinic, hospital, or larger gp surgery.'}, {'blood test': ' an alternative to a skin-prick test is a blood test, which measures the amount of allergic antibodies in the blood.'}, {'food elimination diet': ' in a food elimination diet, the food thought to have caused the allergic reaction is withdrawn\xa0from\xa0the diet for\xa0two to six\xa0weeks. the food is then reintroduced. if the symptoms go away when the food is withdrawn\xa0but\xa0return once the food is introduced again, this normally suggests a food allergy or intolerance. before starting the diet, you should be given advice from a dietitian on issues such as:the\xa0food and drinks you need to avoid how you should interpret food labels if any alternative sources of nutrition are needed how long the diet should last don’t attempt a food elimination diet by yourself without discussing it\xa0with a qualified health professional.'}, {'alternative tests': ' there are\xa0several shop-bought tests available that claim to detect allergies,\xa0but should be avoided. they include:vega testing\xa0–\xa0claims to detect allergies by measuring changes in your electromagnetic field kinesiology testing\xa0–\xa0claims to detect food allergies by studying your muscle responses hair analysis\xa0–\xa0claims to detect food allergies by taking a sample of your hair and running a series of tests on it alternative blood tests (leukocytotoxic tests)\xa0–\xa0claim to detect food allergies by checking for the “swelling of white blood cells” many alternative testing kits are expensive, the scientific principles they are allegedly based on are unproven, and independent reviews have found them to be unreliable. they should therefore be avoided.'}, {'living with a food allergy': ' the advice here is primarily written for parents of a child with a food allergy. however, most of it is also relevant\xa0if you’re an adult with a food allergy.'}, {'your child’s diet': ' there’s currently\xa0no cure for food allergies, although many children will grow out of certain ones, such as allergies to milk and eggs. the most effective way you can prevent symptoms is to remove the offending food\xa0– known as an allergen\xa0–\xa0from their diet. however,\xa0it’s important to check with your gp or the doctor in charge of your child’s care first before eliminating certain foods. removing eggs or peanuts from a child’s diet isn’t going to have much of an impact on their nutrition. both\xa0of these are a good source of protein, but can be replaced by other, alternative sources. a milk allergy can have more of an impact as milk is a good source of calcium, but\xa0there are\xa0many other ways you can incorporate calcium into your child’s diet, including green leafy vegetables. many foods and drinks are fortified with extra calcium. see your gp if you’re concerned that your child’s allergy is affecting their growth and development.'}, {'reading labels': ' it’s very important to check the label of any pre-packed food or drinks your child has in case it contains ingredients they’re allergic to. under\xa0eu law, any pre-packed food or drink sold in the uk must clearly state on the label if it contains the following ingredients:celery cereals that contain gluten\xa0– including wheat, rye, barley and oats crustaceans\xa0– including prawns, crabs and lobsters eggs fish lupin\xa0(common garden plants) – seeds from some varieties are sometimes used to make flour milk molluscs\xa0– including mussels and oysters mustard tree nuts\xa0–\xa0such as almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios and macadamia nuts peanuts sesame seeds soybeans sulphur dioxide and sulphites\xa0(preservatives used in some foods and drinks)\xa0–\xa0at levels above 10mg per kg or per litre some food manufacturers also choose to put allergy advice warning labels\xa0– for example, “contains nuts”\xa0–\xa0on their pre-packed foods if they contain an ingredient known to commonly cause an allergic reaction, such as peanuts, wheat, eggs or milk. however, these aren’t compulsory. if there’s no allergy advice box or “contains” statement on a product, it could still have any of the 14 specified allergens in it. look out for “may contain” labels, such as “may contain traces of peanut”. manufacturers sometimes put this label on their products to warn consumers that they may have become contaminated with another food product when being made. read more detailed information about\xa0allergen labelling\xa0on the food standards agency website. some non-food products contain allergy-causing food:some soaps and shampoos contain soy, egg and tree nut oil some pet foods contain milk and peanuts some glues and adhesive labels used on envelopes and stamps contain traces of wheat again, read the labels of any non-food products your child may come into close physical contact with.'}, {'unpackaged food': ' currently, unpackaged food doesn’t need to be labelled in the same way as packaged food. this can make it more difficult to know what ingredients are in a particular dish. examples of unpackaged food include food sold from:bakeries\xa0– including in-store bakeries in supermarkets delis salad bars “ready-to-eat” sandwich shops takeaways restaurants if you or your child have a severe food allergy, you need to be careful when you eat out. the following advice should help:let the staff know\xa0– when booking a table at a restaurant, make sure the staff know about any allergies. ask for a firm guarantee that the specific food won’t be in any of the dishes served. the food standards agency (fsa) offers chef cards that provide information about allergies, which you can give to restaurant staff. as well as informing the chef and kitchen staff involved in cooking your food, let waiters and waitresses know so they understand the importance of avoiding cross-contamination when serving you. read the menu carefully and check for hidden ingredients\xa0– some food types contain other foods that can trigger allergies, which restaurant staff may have overlooked. some desserts contain nuts (such as a cheesecake base) and some sauces contain wheat and peanuts. prepare for the worst\xa0– it’s a good idea to prepare for any eventuality. always take anti-allergy medication with you when eating out, particularly an adrenalin\xa0auto-injector. read more about\xa0treating food allergies with a auto-injector. use what’s known as a taste test in older children\xa0– before your child begins to eat, ask them to take a tiny portion of the food and rub it against their lips to see if they experience a tingling or burning sensation. if they do, it suggests that the food will cause them to have an allergic reaction. however, the taste test doesn’t work for all foods, so it shouldn’t be used as a substitute for the above advice.'}, {'further advice': ' here’s some more advice for parents:notify your child’s school about their allergy – depending on how severe\xa0their allergy is, it may be necessary to give the staff at their school an emergency action plan in case of accidental exposure. arrange for the school nurse or another staff member to hold a supply of adrenalin. food allergy bracelets,\xa0which explain how other people can help your child in an emergency, are also available. let other parents know\xa0– young children may easily forget about their food allergy and accept food they shouldn’t have when visiting other children. telling the parents of your child’s friends about their allergy should help prevent this. educate your child\xa0– once your child is old enough to understand their allergy, it’s important to give them clear, simple instructions about what foods to avoid and what they should do if they accidentally eat them.'}, {'treating a food allergy': ' there are two main types of medication that can be used to relieve the symptoms of an allergic reaction to foods:antihistamines\xa0– used to treat mild to moderate allergic reaction adrenaline\xa0–\xa0used to treat severe allergic reactions\xa0(anaphylaxis)'}, {'antihistamines': ' antihistamines\xa0work by blocking the effects of histamine,\xa0which is responsible for many of the symptoms of an allergic reaction. many antihistamines are available from your pharmacist without prescription\xa0– stock up in case of an emergency. non-drowsy antihistamines are preferred. some antihistamines, such as alimemazine and promethazine, aren’t suitable for children under the age of\xa0two. if you have a younger child with a food allergy, ask your gp about what types of antihistamines may be suitable. avoid drinking alcohol after taking an antihistamine as this can make you feel drowsy and affect your ability to drive.'}, {'adrenaline': ' adrenaline works by narrowing the blood vessels to counteract the effects of low blood pressure and opening up the airways to help ease breathing difficulties. you’ll be given an auto-injector of adrenaline to use in case of emergencies if you or your child is at\xa0risk of anaphylaxis or had a previous episode of anaphylaxis. read the manufacturer’s instructions that come with the auto-injector carefully and train your child how to use it when they are old enough.'}, {'using an auto-injector': ' if you suspect that somebody is experiencing the\xa0symptoms of anaphylaxis, call\xa0999\xa0and ask for an ambulance. tell the operator that you think the person has anaphylaxis. older children and adults will probably have been trained to inject themselves. you may need to inject younger children or older children and adults who are too sick to inject themselves. there are three types of auto-injectors:epipen jext emerade all three work in much the same way. if anaphylaxis is suspected, you should remove the safety cap from the injector and press firmly against the thigh, holding it at a right angle, without using the thumb at the end. a “click” indicates the auto-injector has been activated, and it should be held in place for 10 seconds. ensure you’re familiar with the device and know the correct end to place against the thigh. the injections can be given through clothing. this will send a needle into your thigh and deliver a dose of adrenaline. if the person is unconscious, check their airways are open and clear, and check their breathing. then put them in\xa0the recovery position. putting someone who is unconscious in the recovery position ensures they don’t choke on their vomit. place the person on their side, making sure they’re supported by one leg and one arm. open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin. if the person’s breathing or heart stops,\xa0cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)\xa0should be performed.'}, {'owning an auto-injector': ' as a precaution, the following advice should be taken:carry the auto-injector at all times or encourage your child to do so if they’re old enough. you may be prescribed two injectors –\xa0check with your gp or the doctor in charge of your care. you may also be given an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your child’s allergy and the contact details of their doctor to alert others. they should wear this at all times. extreme temperatures can make adrenaline less effective. don’t leave an auto-injector in places like your fridge or the glove compartment of your car. check the expiry date regularly.\xa0an out-of-date injector will only offer limited protection. the manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the date of expiry. check the information leaflet that comes with the medication for more information. if your child has an auto-injector, they’ll need to change over to an adult dose once they reach a weight of\xa030 kilos (4.7 stone). depending on the shape and size of your child’s body, this could be anywhere between the ages of\xa05 and 11 years old. don’t delay injecting if you think you or your child may be experiencing the start of anaphylaxis, even if the initial symptoms are mild. it’s better to use adrenaline early and find out it was a false alarm than delay treatment until you’re sure your child is experiencing severe anaphylaxis.'}, {'help us

that form in the gallbladder. in most cases they don’t cause any symptoms and don’t need to be treated. however, if a gallstone becomes trapped in a duct (opening) inside the gallbladder it can trigger a sudden intense abdominal pain that usually lasts between 1\xa0and 5\xa0hours. this type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic. some people with gallstones\xa0can also\xa0develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), which can cause:persistent pain jaundice a fever when gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it’s known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. read more about:symptoms of gallstones complications of gallstones'}, {'the gallbladder': ' the gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. bile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. it’s passed from the liver through a series of channels, known as bile ducts, into the gallbladder. the bile is stored in the gallbladder and over time it becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. the gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it’s needed.'}, {'what causes\xa0gallstones?': ' gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. in most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones. gallstones are very common. it’s estimated that more than 1\xa0in every 10 adults in the uk\xa0has gallstones, although only\xa0a minority\xa0of\xa0people develop symptoms. you’re more at risk of developing gallstones if you’re:overweight\xa0or obese female, particularly if you’ve had children 40 or over (the

laparoscopic cholecystectomy, is relatively simple\xa0to perform and has a low risk of complications. you can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but\xa0the bile will just drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than\xa0build up in the gallbladder. read more about:treating gallstones diagnosing gallstones'}, {'outlook':

thought to be caused by an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. bile is a liquid produced by the liver to aid digestion. it’s still unclear exactly what leads to this imbalance, but gallstones can form if:there are unusually high levels of cholesterol inside the gallbladder (about 4\xa0in every 5\xa0gallstones are made up of cholesterol) there are unusually high levels of a waste product called bilirubin inside the gallbladder (about 1\xa0in every 5\xa0gallstones is made up of bilirubin) these chemical imbalances cause tiny crystals to develop in the bile.

recently lost weight (from either\xa0dieting or weight-loss surgery) are taking an antibiotic called ceftriaxone'}, {'diagnosing gallstones': ' gallstones may be discovered during tests for a different condition, as they often don’t cause any symptoms. if you do have symptoms of gallstones,\xa0make an appointment with your gp so they can try to identify the problem.'}, {'seeing your gp': ' your gp will ask about your symptoms in detail and may\xa0carry out the murphy’s sign test to help determine if your gallbladder is inflamed. during this test, your\xa0gp places their hand or fingers on the upper-right area of your tummy and asks you to breathe in. if you find this painful, it usually\xa0means your gallbladder is inflamed and you may need urgent treatment. your gp may also recommend having\xa0blood tests to look for signs of infection, or to check if your liver is working normally.\xa0if gallstones have moved into your bile duct, the liver may not be able to\xa0function properly.'}, {'further tests': ' if your symptoms and test results suggest you may have gallstones, you’ll usually be referred for further tests. you may be admitted to hospital for tests the same day if your symptoms suggest you have a more severe form of gallbladder disease.'}, {'treating gallstones': ' your treatment plan for gallstones depends on how the symptoms are affecting your daily life. if you don’t have any symptoms, a policy of ‘active monitoring’ is often recommended. this means you won’t receive immediate treatment, but you should let your gp know if you notice any symptoms. as a general rule, the longer you go without symptoms, the less likely it is that your condition will get worse. you may need treatment if you have a condition that increases your risk of\xa0developing complications, such as:scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) high blood pressure inside the liver – this is known as portal hypertension and is often a complication of\xa0alcohol-related liver disease diabetes treatment may also be recommended if a scan shows high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, as this can lead to\xa0gallbladder cancer in later life. if you have episodes of abdominal pain (biliary colic), treatment depends on how the pain affects your daily activities. if\xa0the episodes are\xa0mild and infrequent, you may be prescribed painkillers to control further episodes and given advice about\xa0eating a healthy diet to help control the pain. if your symptoms are more severe and occur frequently,\xa0surgery to remove the gallbladder\xa0is usually recommended. the gallbladder isn’t an essential organ and\xa0you can lead a perfectly normal life without one.\xa0some people may experience symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating fatty or spicy food. if certain foods do trigger symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future.'}, {'keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder': ' if surgery is recommended, you’ll usually have keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. this is known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. during\xa0a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3\xa0or 4\xa0small cuts are made in your abdomen. one larger cut (about 2cm to 3cm) will be by the belly button and the others (each 1cm or less) will be on the right side of your abdomen. your abdomen is temporarily inflated using carbon dioxide gas. this is harmless and makes it easier for the surgeon to see your organs. a\xa0laparoscope (long thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera at the end) is inserted through one of the cuts in your abdomen. this allows your surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor.\xa0your surgeon will then remove your gallbladder using special surgical instruments. if it’s thought there may be gallstones in the bile duct, an x-ray or ultrasound scan of the bile duct is also taken during the operation. if gallstones are found, they may be removed during keyhole surgery. if the operation can’t be done this way or an unexpected complication occurs, it may have to be converted to open surgery. after the gallbladder has been removed, the gas in your abdomen escapes through the laparoscope and the cuts are closed with dissolvable stitches and covered with dressings. laparoscopic cholecystectomies are\xa0usually performed under a general anaesthetic, which means you’ll be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain while it’s carried out. the operation takes 60 to 90 minutes and you can usually go home the same\xa0day.\xa0full recovery typically takes around 10 days.'}, {'open surgery': ' a\xa0laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not always be recommended, for example if you:are in the third trimester (the last three months) of pregnancy are extremely overweight have an unusual gallbladder or bile duct structure that makes a\xa0keyhole procedure difficult and potentially dangerous in these circumstances, an open cholecystectomy may be recommended. during this procedure, a 10cm to 15cm (4in to 6in) incision is made in your abdomen underneath the ribs so the gallbladder can be removed.\xa0this\xa0is done under general anaesthetic, so you’ll be asleep and won’t feel any pain. open surgery is just as effective as laparoscopic surgery, but it does have a longer recovery time and causes more visible scarring. most people have to stay in hospital for up to 5\xa0days and it typically takes 6\xa0weeks to fully recover.'}, {'endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ercp)': ' an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ercp) is a procedure that can be used to remove gallstones from the bile duct. the gallbladder isn’t removed during this procedure, so any stones in the gallbladder will remain unless removed using the surgical techniques mentioned above. ercp is similar to a diagnostic cholangiography (see diagnosing gallstones for more information), where an endoscope (long, thin flexible tube with a camera at the end) is passed through your mouth down to where the bile duct opens into the small intestine. however, during ercp the\xa0opening of the bile duct\xa0is widened with a small incision or an electrically heated wire. the bile duct stones are then removed or left to pass into your intestine and out of your body. sometimes a small tube called a stent is permanently placed in the bile duct to help the bile and stones pass. an ercp is usually carried out under sedation, which means you’ll be awake throughout the procedure but won’t experience any pain. the ercp procedure\xa0lasts about 30 minutes on average, but can take from 15 minutes to over an hour.\xa0you may need to stay overnight in hospital after the procedure so you can be monitored.'}, {'medication to dissolve gallstones': ' if your\xa0gallstones are small and don’t contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid\xa0tablets to dissolve them. however, these aren’t\xa0prescribed very often because:they’re\xa0rarely very effective they need to be taken for a long time (up to 2\xa0years) gallstones can recur once treatment is stopped side effects of ursodeoxycholic acid are uncommon and are usually mild. the most commonly reported side effects are feeling sick, being sick and itchy skin. the use of ursodeoxycholic acid isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. sexually active women should use either a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, or a low-dose oestrogen contraceptive pill while taking ursodeoxycholic acid, as it may affect other types of oral contraceptive pills. ursodeoxycholic acid tablets are occasionally also prescribed as a precaution against gallstones if it’s thought you’re at risk of developing them. for example, you may be prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid if you’ve recently had weight loss surgery, as rapid weight loss can cause gallstones to grow.'}, {'complications of gallstones': ' a small number of people with gallstones may develop serious problems if the gallstones cause a severe blockage or move into another part of the digestive system.'}, {'inflammation of the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis)': ' in some cases of gallstone disease a bile duct can become permanently blocked, which can lead to a build-up of bile inside the gallbladder. this can cause the gallbladder to become infected and inflamed. the medical term for inflammation of the gallbladder is acute cholecystitis. symptoms include:pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade (unlike biliary colic, the pain usually lasts longer than five hours) a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above a rapid heartbeat an estimated 1\xa0in 7\xa0people with acute cholecystitis also experience jaundice (see below). acute cholecystitis is usually treated first with antibiotics to settle the infection and then keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder. this operation can be more difficult when performed as an emergency and there’s a higher risk of it being converted to an open procedure. sometimes a\xa0severe infection can lead to a gallbladder abscess (empyema of the gallbladder). antibiotics alone don’t always treat these and they may need to be drained. occasionally a severely inflamed gallbladder\xa0can tear, leading to\xa0peritonitis\xa0(inflammation of the inside lining of the abdomen).\xa0if this happens, you may need to have antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenous antibiotics) and surgery may be required to remove a section of the lining if part of it becomes severely damaged. read more about acute cholecystitis.'}, {'jaundice': ' if a gallstone passes out of the gallbladder into the bile duct and blocks the flow of bile, jaundice occurs. symptoms of jaundice include:yellowing of the skin and eyes dark brown urine pale stools itching sometimes the stone passes from the bile duct on its own. if it doesn’t, the stone needs to be removed. see treating gallstones.'}, {'infection of the bile ducts (acute cholangitis)': ' if the bile ducts become blocked, they’re vulnerable to infection by bacteria. the medical term for a bile duct infection is acute cholangitis. symptoms of acute cholangitis include:pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade a high temperature jaundice chills confusion itchy skin generally feeling unwell antibiotics will help treat the infection, but it’s also important to help the bile from the liver to drain with an\xa0endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ercp). read treating gallstones for more information.'}, {'acute pancreatitis': ' acute pancreatitis\xa0may develop when a gallstone moves out of the gallbladder and blocks the opening (duct) of the pancreas, causing it to become inflamed. the most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is a sudden severe dull pain in the centre of your upper abdomen, around the top of your stomach. the pain of acute pancreatitis often gets steadily worse until it reaches a constant ache. the ache may travel from your abdomen and along your back and may feel worse after you have eaten. leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain. other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:feeling sick being sick diarrhoea loss of appetite a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above tenderness of the abdomen less commonly, jaundice there’s currently no cure for acute pancreatitis, so treatment focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed. this usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given:fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids) pain relief nutritional support oxygen through tubes into your nose with treatment,\xa0most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days. read more about acute pancreatitis.'}, {'cancer of the gallbladder': ' gallbladder cancer\xa0is a rare but serious complication of gallstones. an estimated 660 cases of gallbladder cancer are diagnosed in the uk each year. having a history of gallstones increases your risk of developing gallbladder cancer.\xa0approximately 4\xa0out of every 5\xa0people who have cancer of the gallbladder also have a history of gallstones. however, people with a history of gallstones have a less than one in 10,000 chance of developing gallbladder cancer. if you have additional risk factors, such as a family history of gallbladder cancer or high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, it may be recommended that your gallbladder be removed as a precaution, even if your gallstones aren’t causing any symptoms. the symptoms of gallbladder cancer are similar to those of complicated gallstone disease, including:abdominal pain high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above jaundice gallbladder cancer can be treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.'}, {'gallstone ileus': ' another rare but serious complication of gallstones is known as gallstone ileus. this is where the bowel becomes obstructed by a gallstone. gallstone ileus can occur when an abnormal channel, known as a fistula, opens up near the gallbladder. gallstones are then able to travel through the fistula and can block the bowel. symptoms of gallstone ileus include:abdominal pain being sick swelling of the abdomen constipation a bowel obstruction requires immediate medical treatment. if it’s not treated, there’s a risk that the bowel could split open (rupture). this could cause internal bleeding and widespread infection. if you

bowel. the type of surgery you receive depends on where in the bowel the obstruction has occurred.'}, {'preventing gallstones': ' from the limited evidence available, changes to your diet and losing weight (if you’re overweight) may help prevent gallstones.'}, {'diet': ' because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it is advisable to avoid eating too many foods

through:kissing\xa0– glandular fever is sometimes referred to as the ‘kissing disease’ sharing food and drinks sharing toothbrushes exposure to coughs and sneezes small children may be infected by chewing toys that have been contaminated with the virus. when you come into contact with infected saliva, the virus can infect the cells on the lining of your throat. the infection is then passed into your white blood cells before spreading through the lymphatic system. this is a series of glands (nodes) found throughout your body that allows many of the cells that your immune system needs to travel around the body. after the infection has passed, people develop lifelong immunity to the virus and most won’t develop symptoms again. many people are first exposed to ebv during childhood, when the infection causes few symptoms and often goes unrecognised before it eventually passes. young adults may be most at risk of glandular fever because they might not have been exposed to the virus when they were younger, and the infection tends to produce more severe symptoms when you’re older.'}, {'ebv carriers': ' not everyone who can pass on ebv will have symptoms themselves. these are known as asymptomatic carriers. some people can have the virus in their saliva for a few months after recovering from glandular fever, and may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. this is because the virus remains inactive in the body for the rest of your life after you have been exposed to it. for most people, the inactive virus won’t cause any symptoms. however, there is a chance of the virus periodically becoming reactivated, which may mean it re-enters the saliva. this reactivation may be without any symptoms, or it\xa0may cause symptoms to recur for a short time.'}, {'treating glandular fever': ' there is currently no cure for glandular fever, but the symptoms should pass within a few weeks. there are things you can do to help control your symptoms.'},

of warm, salty water may also help relieve your\xa0sore throat.'}, {'rest': ' take plenty of rest while you recover from glandular fever. complete bed rest is no longer recommended because it\xa0may make the fatigue last longer. you should gradually increase your activities as your energy levels return, but avoid activities you cannot manage comfortably. for the first month after your symptoms begin, avoid contact sports or activities that put you at risk of falling. this is because you may have a swollen spleen that\xa0it’s more vulnerable to damage, and a sudden knock could cause it to burst (rupture).'}, {'preventing the spread of infection': ' there is no need to be isolated from others if you have glandular fever\xa0as most people will already be immune to the epstein-barr virus (ebv). you can return to work, college or school as soon as you feel well enough. there’s little risk of spreading the infection to others as long as you follow commonsense precautions while you are ill, such as not kissing other people or sharing utensils. it’s also important to\xa0thoroughly clean anything that may have been contaminated by saliva until you have recovered.'}, {'antibiotics and steroids': ' antibiotics\xa0are not effective in treating glandular fever because they have no effect on viruses,\xa0but they\xa0may be prescribed if you also develop a bacterial infection of\xa0your

treatment may be necessary for a few days if you or your child:develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties find swallowing fluids difficult develop intense abdominal pain treatment in hospital may involve receiving fluids or antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously), corticosteroid injections and pain relief. in\xa0a small number of\xa0cases, emergency surgery

further problems. however, complications can develop in a few cases.'}, {'prolonged fatigue': ' more than\xa01 in every 10 people with glandular fever will experience prolonged fatigue, which lasts for 6 months or more after the initial infection. it’s not known why fatigue lasts longer in some people. some experts think it may be a form of chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs). this is a poorly understood condition that causes persistent fatigue and a range of other symptoms, such as headaches and joint pain. adopting a gradual exercise plan to rebuild your strength and energy levels may help\xa0prevent and reduce prolonged fatigue.'}, {'reduction in\xa0blood cells': ' in a few cases, glandular fever can lead to a reduction in some blood cells. it can reduce levels of:red blood cells (anaemia)\xa0–\xa0this can make you feel tired and out of breath white blood cells (neutropenia)\xa0–\xa0this can make you more prone to developing a secondary infection platelets – this can make you bruise and bleed more easily in most cases, the reduction in the\xa0number of blood cells is small and only causes mild symptoms. these problems should get better by themselves within a few weeks or months.'}, {'ruptured spleen': ' around half of people who develop glandular fever will have a swollen spleen. this does not present any immediate health problems, but\xa0there is a small risk of it rupturing (bursting). the main sign of a ruptured spleen is\xa0sharp pain in the left of the tummy (abdomen). go to\xa0your local accident and emergency (a&e) department or phone 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you develop intense abdominal pain. the risk of the spleen rupturing is small, occurring in just\xa01 in every 500 to 1,000 cases of glandular fever, but it can be life threatening because it may cause severe internal bleeding. in some cases,\xa0emergency surgery may be required to remove an enlarged or\xa0ruptured spleen\xa0(splenectomy). a ruptured spleen usually occurs as a result of damage caused by vigorous physical activities, such as contact sports. it’s therefore very important to avoid these activities for at least a month after the symptoms of glandular fever begin. be particularly careful during the second and third week of your illness, as this is when the spleen is most vulnerable.'}, {'neurological complications': ' in less than\xa01 in every 100 cases, the epstein-barr virus (ebv) can affect the nervous system and trigger a range of neurological complications, including:guillain-barré syndrome\xa0– where the nerves become inflamed, causing symptoms such as numbness, weakness\xa0and temporary paralysis bell’s palsy\xa0– where\xa0the muscles on one side of the face become\xa0temporarily weak or paralysed viral meningitis – an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord; although unpleasant,\xa0viral meningitis\xa0is much less serious than bacterial meningitis, which is life threatening encephalitis\xa0– an infection of the brain these complications will often need specific treatment, but more than four out of every five people with them will make a full recovery.'}, {'secondary infection': ' in a small number of cases, the initial infection weakens your immune system and allows bacteria to infect parts of the body. this is called a secondary bacterial infection. possible secondary infections that can develop during glandular fever include serious conditions such as pneumonia (infection of the lung) and\xa0pericarditis (infection of the sac that surrounds the heart). secondary infections usually occur in people who have a very weak immune system, such as people with hiv or aids, or those having\xa0chemotherapy. if you have a weakened immune system and you develop

also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids. other factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include:being overweight or obese age\xa0– as you get older, your body’s supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids being\xa0pregnant\xa0– which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more about

and won’t feel any pain while it’s carried out. a conventional haemorrhoidectomy involves gently opening the anus so the haemorrhoids can be cut out. you’ll need to take a week or so off work to recover. you’ll probably experience significant pain after the operation, but you will be given painkillers. you may still have pain a few weeks after the procedure, which can also be controlled with painkillers. seek medical advice if you have pain that continues for longer. after having a haemorrhoidectomy, there’s around a 1 in 20 chance of the haemorrhoids returning, which is lower than with non-surgical treatments. adopting or continuing a high-fibre diet after surgery is recommended to reduce this risk.'}, {'haemorrhoidal artery ligation': ' haemorrhoidal artery ligation is an operation to reduce the blood flow to your haemorrhoids. it’s usually carried out under general anaesthetic and involves inserting a small\xa0ultrasound probe into your anus. the probe produces high-frequency sound waves that allow the surgeon to locate the vessels supplying blood to the haemorrhoid. each blood vessel is stitched closed to block the blood supply to the haemorrhoid, which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink over the following days and weeks. the stitches can also be used to reduce prolapsing haemorrhoids (haemorrhoids that hang down from the anus). the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends haemorrhoidal artery ligation as a safe and\xa0effective alternative to a haemorrhoidectomy or stapled haemorrhoidopexy (see below). it causes less pain and, in terms of results, a high level of satisfaction has been reported. the recovery time after having haemorrhoidal artery ligation is also quicker\xa0compared with other surgical procedures. there’s a low risk of bleeding, pain when passing stools, or the haemorrhoid becoming prolapsed after this procedure, but these usually improve within a few weeks.'}, {'stapling': ' stapling, also known as stapled haemorrhoidopexy, is an alternative to a conventional haemorrhoidectomy. it’s sometimes used to treat prolapsed haemorrhoids and is carried out under general anaesthetic. the procedure isn’t carried out as often as it used to be, because it has a slightly higher risk of serious complications than the alternative treatments available. during the operation, part of the anorectum (the last section of the large intestine), is stapled. this means the haemorrhoids are less likely to prolapse and it reduces the supply of blood to the haemorrhoids, which causes them to gradually shrink. stapling has a shorter recovery time than a traditional haemorrhoidectomy, and you can probably return to work about a week afterwards. it also tends to be a less painful procedure. however, after stapling, more people experience another prolapsed haemorrhoid compared with having a haemorrhoidectomy. there have also been a very small number of serious complications following the stapling procedure, such as fistula to vagina in women (where a small channel develops between the anal canal and the vagina) or rectal perforation (where a hole develops in the rectum).'}, {'other treatments': ' other treatment options are available, including freezing and laser treatment. however, the number of nhs or private surgeons who perform these treatments is limited.'}, {'general risks of haemorrhoid surgery': ' although the risk of serious problems is small, complications can occasionally occur after haemorrhoid surgery. these can include:bleeding or passing\xa0blood clots,\xa0which\xa0may happen a week or so after the operation infection, which\xa0may lead to a build-up of pus (known as an abscess)\xa0– you may be given a short course of\xa0antibiotics after surgery to reduce this risk urinary

can have symptoms too. symptoms can include:shortness of breath palpitations (irregular heartbeat) dizzy spells/fainting nausea'}, {'how the heart beats': ' when the heart beats,\xa0the heart muscle contracts (pulls inwards) in order to pump blood around the body. the contractions are triggered by electrical impulses that are generated by a selection of specialised cells that are known as the sinoatrial node (sa node). the sa node is often referred to as a natural pacemaker because, like artificial pacemakers, it generates a series of electrical impulses at regular intervals. the impulse is then sent to another selection of cells that are known as the atrioventricular node (av node). the av node conducts the impulse into the two lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles). a heart block occurs if the transmission of the impulse between the av node and the ventricles is interrupted. a heart block does not mean that the heart stops beating altogether, because other ‘back-up’ systems can take over. however, it can result in an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia), leading to the body’s organs and tissue becoming deprived of oxygen.'}, {'types of heart block': ' there

procedure may be carried out using a local anaesthetic or a sedative to help you relax.'}, {'barium meal x-ray': ' the barium meal\xa0x-ray, also called the barium swallow test, is an effective way of\xa0identifying a hiatus hernia. as part of the test, you’ll be asked to drink some barium solution. barium is a non-toxic chemical\xa0that shows up clearly on an\xa0x-ray. once the barium moves down into your digestive system, a series of x-rays will be taken to identify any problems. if you need to have a barium meal x-ray, you won’t be able to eat or drink anything for at least 6\xa0hours before the procedure, so that your stomach and duodenum (the top of the small intestine) are empty. you may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system. you’ll be given a white, chalky liquid containing barium to drink while lying down. this will allow the specialist to see your stomach on an x-ray monitor more easily, as well as any ulcers or abnormal growths. your\xa0bed may be tipped slightly during the test, so that the barium fills all the areas of your stomach. a barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes to perform. afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. you may feel slightly sick after a barium meal x-ray and the barium may cause constipation. your stools may also be white for a few days afterwards, as the barium passes through your system.'}, {'treating hiatus hernia': ' treatment for a hiatus hernia is usually only necessary if it’s causing problems. in most cases, people with a hiatus hernia only experience problems if the hernia causes\xa0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord). gord can cause symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in your mouth. lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments, although surgery may be used as an alternative to long-term medication, or if other treatments are ineffective.'}, {'lifestyle changes': ' there are several things you can do yourself to help relieve\xa0symptoms of gord caused by a hiatus hernia. these include:eating smaller, more

in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. the lymphatic system is part of your immune system. clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes. in hodgkin lymphoma, b-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). the affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. the most common symptom of hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. read more about the symptoms of hodgkin lymphoma.'}, {'who’s affected?': ' hodgkin

for the condition. read more about:treatment for hodgkin lymphoma complications of hodgkin lymphoma'}, {'symptoms of hodgkin lymphoma': ' the most common symptom of hodgkin lymphoma is a swelling in the neck, armpit or groin. the swelling is usually painless, although some people find that it aches. the swelling is caused by an excess of affected lymphocytes (white blood cells) collecting in a lymph node (also called lymph glands). lymph nodes are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. they contain white blood cells that help to fight infection. however, it’s highly unlikely

instructions so the cells keep growing, causing them to multiply uncontrollably. the abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as

no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. it’s important to\xa0stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this\xa0point. the advice below can also\xa0help to prevent the spread of the infection:do not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo – wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing avoid\xa0touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them\xa0– it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym\xa0– until the risk of infection has passed wash your hands frequently\xa0– particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed\xa0– wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely if you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they’re seen by a pharmacist as soon as possible.'}, {'preventing recurrent\xa0impetigo': ' to\xa0reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly. if you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. these bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby. if you’re found to carry these bacteria,\xa0you may be prescribed an antiseptic\xa0nasal cream to apply several times a day for 5 to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring.'}, {'complications of impetigo': ' complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse. some complications associated with impetigo include:cellulitis\xa0– an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue scarlet fever\xa0–\xa0a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body guttate\xa0psoriasis\xa0–\xa0a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a

particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores'}, {'symptoms of impetigo': ' impetigo does not cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after you first become infected. this means that people can easily pass the infection on to others without realising it. there are 2 main types of impetigo, known as non-bullous and bullous impetigo, which have different symptoms. most people with impetigo have the non-bullous type.'}, {'non-bullous impetigo': ' the symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. the sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. the appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. after the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually heals without scarring. the time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. the sores are not painful, but they may be itchy. it is important not to touch, or scratch, the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of your body, and to other people. other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.'}, {'bullous impetigo': ' the symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the trunk (the central part of the body between the waist and neck) or on the arms and legs. the blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across. the blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. the blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. as with non-bullous impetigo, it is important that you do not touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin. symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.'}, {'causes of impetigo': ' impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. these bacteria can infect the skin in 2 ways:through a break in otherwise healthy skin, such as\xa0a cut, insect bite or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema – this is known as secondary impetigo the bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels. as the condition does not cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it is often easily spread to others unintentionally. impetigo stops being infectious after 48 hours of treatment starting or after the sores have stopped blistering or crusting.'}, {'increased risk': ' in addition to the situations mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that can increase your chances of developing impetigo. these include:being a child – impetigo is thought to be more common in children because their immune system has not yet fully developed and because they tend to spend time in places where the infection can easily be spread, such as schools and nurseries having diabetes being a carrier of staphylococcus aureus bacteria – these bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, but they can sometimes cause impetigo if they get into damaged skin nearby warm and humid weather – impetigo tends to be more common during the summer months in the uk, possibly because the warm and moist weather is a better environment for the bacteria to grow and/or because the skin is more likely to be exposed to insect bites and cuts at this time of year having a weakened immune system, either due to a condition such as hiv or a treatment such as chemotherapy'}, {'treating impetigo': ' impetigo isn’t usually serious and often clears up without treatment after 2 to 3 weeks. treatment is often recommended as it can help clear up the infection in around 7 to 10 days and reduce the risk of the infection being passed on to others. if impetigo is confirmed, it can usually be effectively treated with antibiotics. if the infection is being caused by an underlying skin condition, such as eczema, this may also need to be treated.'}, {'antibiotic cream': ' for mild cases of impetigo that cover a small area, antibiotic cream is often recommended. this usually needs to be applied 3 or 4 times a day for 7 days. before applying\xa0the cream, wash any\xa0affected areas of skin with warm, soapy water and try to clean off any crusts that have developed. to reduce the risk of spreading the infection, it’s also important that you\xa0wash your hands immediately after applying the cream or, if available, wear latex gloves while applying the cream. side effects of antibiotic cream can include:irritation redness itchiness in the area where the cream is applied if symptoms haven’t improved\xa0after seven days of starting treatment,\xa0ask your pharmacist about other possible treatment options.'}, {'antibiotic tablets': ' antibiotic tablets may be prescribed\xa0if the infection is more severe and widespread, or\xa0if the symptoms don’t improve after using antibiotic cream. these usually need to be taken 2 to 4 times a day for 7 days. if a course of oral antibiotics is prescribed for you or your child, it’s very important that the course is finished even if the symptoms clear up before you’ve taken\xa0all\xa0the tablets. common side effects of oral antibiotics include:feeling sick vomiting diarrhoea speak to your pharmacist if your symptoms haven’t improved after 7 days of treatment with antibiotic tablets.'}, {'further testing and treatment': ' further tests are usually only required in cases where the infection is severe or widespread, doesn’t respond to treatment, or keeps recurring. in these circumstances, your gp may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for further tests or they may take a swab\xa0of the affected skin\xa0themselves for testing. this can help to rule out or confirm other skin conditions that may be responsible for your symptoms and can detect whether you carry one of the types of bacteria responsible for the\xa0infection inside your nose. if your doctor thinks you may keep getting\xa0impetigo because you naturally have these bacteria inside your nose, they may prescribe you an antiseptic nasal cream to try to clear the bacteria.'}, {'complications of impetigo': ' complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.'}, {'cellulitis': ' cellulitis occurs when the infection spreads to a deeper layer of skin. it can cause symptoms of red, inflamed skin with fever and pain. it can usually be treated with antibiotics, and\xa0painkillers can be used to relieve pain.'}, {'guttate psoriasis': ' guttate\xa0psoriasis is a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection. it is usually more common after a throat infection, but some cases have been linked to impetigo. guttate psoriasis causes small, red, droplet-shaped, scaly patches on the chest, arms, legs and scalp. creams can be used to control the symptoms and in some cases\xa0the condition will disappear completely after a few weeks.'}, {'scarlet fever': ' scarlet fever\xa0is a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body. associated symptoms of infection, such as nausea, pain and vomiting, are also common.\xa0the condition is usually treated with antibiotics. scarlet fever is not usually serious but it is contagious. therefore, it’s important to isolate an infected child and avoid close physical contact. keep your child away from school and other people until\xa0they have\xa0been taking\xa0antibiotics for at least 24 hours.'}, {'septicaemia': ' septicaemia (a type of sepsis) is a bacterial infection of the blood. it can cause:diarrhoea cold, clammy skin a high temperature (fever) rapid breathing vomiting low blood pressure\xa0(hypotension) confusion feeling faint and dizzy losing consciousness septicaemia is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics in hospital.'}, {'scarring': ' in rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring. however, this is more often the result of someone scratching at blisters, crusts or sores. the blisters and crusts themselves should not leave a scar if left to heal. the red mark left after the crusts and blisters clear up should also disappear by itself. the time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.'}, {'staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome': ' staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (ssss) is a serious skin condition in which one of the causes of impetigo – staphylococcus bacteria – releases a toxin (poison) that damages the skin. this leads to extensive blistering that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water. other symptoms of ssss include:painful skin a high temperature (fever) large areas of skin peeling off or falling away redness of the skin which usually spreads across the entire body ssss usually requires immediate treatment in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).'}, {'post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis': ' post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys. it’s a very rare complication of impetigo. the symptoms of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis include:a change in the colour of your urine to a reddish-brown or cola colour swelling of the abdomen (tummy),\xa0face, eyes, feet and ankles a rise in blood pressure visible\xa0blood in your urine a reduction in the amount of urine you would normally produce people with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis will usually require immediate hospital treatment so their blood pressure can be carefully monitored and controlled. post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can be fatal in adults, although deaths in children are rare.'}, {'preventing impetigo': ' as impetigo is a highly contagious condition, it is important to take precautions to reduce the risk of the infection spreading.'}, {'stopping\xa0the infection spreading': ' to help to prevent the spread of the infection to other people or to other areas of the body you should:stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until the sores have dried up, blistered or crusted over,

many people, but in most cases it’s mild and only occurs occasionally. read more about the\xa0symptoms of indigestion.'}, {'why it happens': ' indigestion\xa0may be\xa0caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). the stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. the majority of people with indigestion don’t have inflammation in their digestive system. therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching). in most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be\xa0triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress\xa0or taking certain medications. read more about the\xa0causes of indigestion.'}, {'treating indigestion at home': ' most people are able to\xa0treat indigestion with simple changes to their\xa0diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different

increasing\xa0difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) you have persistent vomiting you have\xa0iron deficiency anaemia you have a lump in your stomach you have blood in your vomit or\xa0blood in your stools this is because these symptoms\xa0may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a\xa0stomach ulcer\xa0or\xa0stomach cancer. you may need to be referred for an endoscopy\xa0to rule out any serious cause. an endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end). severe indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach. read more about the possible\xa0complications of severe indigestion.'},

of different causes, but it’s rarely due to a serious, underlying condition. it’s normal for your stomach to produce acid, but sometimes this acid can irritate the lining of your stomach, the top part of your bowel (duodenum) or your gullet (oesophagus). this irritation can be painful and often causes a burning sensation. indigestion may also be due to the lining of your digestive system being overly sensitive to acid, or the ‘stretching’ caused by eating. indigestion can also be triggered or made worse\xa0by other factors.'}, {'medications': ' you may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up. other medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), can affect your digestive tract and cause\xa0indigestion. do\xa0not take nsaids, such as aspirin and

heart conditions are caused when there’s a change in one or more of your genes. this is known as a gene variant. if one of your parents has a gene variant, there’s a 50% chance it will be passed on to you (inherited). if you do inherit the gene variant, there’s also a 50% chance you could pass it on to each of your children. if you do not inherit the gene variant, you can’t pass it on to your children. most inherited heart conditions follow this pattern. each person is affected by each gene variant differently. this means you could have a gene variant and not have any symptoms. but, you

anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). in women\xa0of reproductive age,\xa0heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby\xa0during pregnancy. unless you’re pregnant, it’s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. however, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you’re more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above. read more about the causes of iron deficiency anaemia'}, {'how iron deficiency anaemia is treated': ' treatment for iron

supplements and changing your diet to increase your iron levels, as well as treating the underlying cause.'}, {'iron supplements': ' your gp will prescribe an iron supplement to restore the iron missing from your body. the most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate,\xa0which is taken\xa0as a tablet, usually twice a day. some people can\xa0experience side effects when taking iron supplements, including:abdominal (tummy) pain constipation\xa0or diarrhoea heartburn feeling sick black stools (faeces) these side effects should settle down over time. however, your gp may recommend taking the tablets with food or shortly after eating if you have troublesome side effects. your gp may also advise you to only take one or two tablets a day, instead of three, if you’re finding side effects difficult to cope with. if you can’t take ferrous sulphate because you get severe side effects, you may be prescribed a different iron supplement called ferrous gluconate. this supplement should cause fewer side effects because it contains a less concentrated dose of iron. however, it may take longer for the iron levels in your body to be restored. in\xa0a few\xa0cases\xa0–\xa0for

highly unlikely to be caused by kidney cancer, it could\xa0be\xa0a symptom of a less serious condition that still requires treatment, such as a\xa0kidney stone\xa0or bladder stone.'}, {'causes and risk factors of kidney cancer': ' the exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown, but there are risk factors that can increase the chances of developing the condition. the\xa03\xa0main risk factors for kidney cancer are:obesity smoking family history and genetics'}, {'obesity': ' obesity is\xa0a significant risk factor for kidney cancer. there’s a strong link between someone’s\xa0body mass index (bmi) and their risk of developing kidney cancer. read more about\xa0how bmi is calculated,\xa0and work out your bmi. a bmi score of 25 or above has been shown to increase a person’s chances of developing kidney cancer. those with a bmi score of 30 or above are at particularly high risk. this may be because overweight or obese people, particularly women, have higher levels of a hormone called oestrogen in their body. it’s thought that excess levels of oestrogen may stimulate the growth of cancerous cells. cases of kidney cancer have been increasing over the last 40 years, which has been linked to rising obesity levels.'}, {'smoking': ' smoking is also a\xa0significant risk factor for developing kidney cancer, and the more you smoke the greater the risk. for example, research has shown that if you regularly smoke 10 cigarettes a day, you’re one-and-a-half times\xa0more likely to develop kidney cancer compared to a non-smoker. this increases to twice as likely\xa0if you smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day. it’s not clear why smoking increases your chances of developing kidney cancer.'}, {'family history and genetics': ' if you have a close family member (parents, brothers, sisters or a child) who’s been diagnosed with kidney cancer, you’re about twice as likely to develop kidney cancer yourself. examples of inherited genetic conditions and syndromes that increase your risk of developing kidney cancer include:tuberous sclerosis – a rare genetic condition that causes multiple non-cancerous (benign) tumours to grow in the body; it’s autosomal dominant, which means you only have to inherit the faulty gene from one parent to get it; about 1 in every 100 people with tuberous sclerosis will develop kidney cancer hereditary papillary kidney cancer – a rare form of cancer caused by faulty genes inherited from your parents; it’s autosomal dominant and causes small, slow-growing, cancerous tumours to develop in the kidneys, which can sometimes spread hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (hlrcc) – a rare, autosomal dominant form of cancer, where cancerous tumours develop from smooth muscle tissue (leiomyomatas); people with hlrcc have a 10\xa0to 16% increased risk of developing kidney cancer von hippel-lindau syndrome – a rare genetic syndrome that causes small non-cancerous tumours to develop inside the nervous system; vhl is also autosomal dominant and about 4 out of 10 people who have it develop kidney cancer birt-hogg-dubé syndrome – an inherited syndrome that causes non-cancerous tumours to develop in the hair follicles of the skin; they usually occur on the face, neck and torso'}, {'other\xa0possible risk factors': ' there are also a\xa0number of other possible risk factors for developing kidney cancer, including:mild painkillers – some mild painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of developing kidney cancer;\xa0nsaids, such as\xa0ibuprofen, may slightly increase the risk, although occasional use or low doses are unlikely to be harmful kidney disease\xa0– if you have kidney failure and need to have regular\xa0dialysis\xa0(treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys), your risk of developing kidney cysts and kidney cancer is increased high blood pressure (hypertension)\xa0– high blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney disease, and you’re up to twice as likely to develop kidney cancer if you have raised blood pressure'}, {'diagnosing kidney cancer': ' in many cases, kidney cancer is diagnosed after routine scans and check-ups, as the condition doesn’t always have obvious symptoms. you should speak to your gp if you have any symptoms of kidney cancer,\xa0such as\xa0blood in your urine or a constant pain below your ribs. your gp will examine you and, if they think your symptoms need further assessment, refer you to a specialist urologist (a doctor who\xa0specialises in\xa0conditions that affect the urinary tract). if you notice blood in your urine,\xa0your gp will usually\xa0carry out a\xa0blood test\xa0and take a urine sample. the results will help rule out other\xa0possible causes, such as infection or\xa0kidney stones. in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of\xa0renal (kidney) cancer\xa0and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected\xa0kidney cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines on\xa0suspected cancer: recognition and referral. if you need to be referred urgently, you’ll usually be seen within 2 weeks.'}, {'further tests': ' if your gp refers you to a hospital specialist,\xa0further tests will help\xa0determine whether you have kidney cancer.'}, {'staging and grading': ' if kidney cancer is confirmed, it’s usually possible to determine its grade and stage. the stage describes how far the cancer has spread, and the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how quickly it’s likely to spread. both the stage and grade of your kidney cancer will help determine your recommended treatment and the likelihood of achieving a cure. healthcare professionals use the tnm system\xa0to stage kidney cancer:t – indicates how large the tumour has grown (a tumour is a lump of cancerous tissue) n – indicates whether nearby lymph nodes are affected (lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands found throughout the body, which help protect against infection) m – indicates whether the cancer has spread to another part of the body (m stands for metastases, which is the medical term for cancer that has spread) the stages of tumour size are:t1a – where the tumour is less than 4cm (about 1.6 inches)\xa0in diameter t1b – where the tumour is 4\xa0to 7cm (about 1.6-2.8 inches) in diameter t2 – where the tumour is larger than 7cm (2.8 inches)\xa0in diameter, but hasn’t spread out of the kidney t3a – where the tumour has spread into the adrenal gland or the layer of fat surrounding the kidney t3b – where the tumour has spread into the renal vein (the vein that carries blood back from the kidney to the heart) or into the vena cava (the vein that carries blood back from the top half of the body) t3c – where the tumour has spread past the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the top part of the abdomen from the bottom part) t4 – where the tumour has spread beyond the tough layer of tissue that surrounds and protects the kidney there are 3 lymph node stages:n0 – where no lymph nodes have been affected n1 – where there are cancer cells in 1 lymph node n2 – where there are cancer cells in 2 or more lymph nodes m0 means that the cancer hasn’t spread to another part of the body. m1 means that the cancer has spread. kidney cancer is graded using a scale of one to four. the higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer.'}, {'coping with cancer': ' being diagnosed with cancer can be very distressing, particularly if it’s incurable. the news can often be difficult to take in and comprehend. after cancer has been diagnosed, you may find that talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist helps you deal with\xa0feelings

pages about\xa0living with cancer.'}, {'treating kidney cancer': ' the treatment of kidney cancer depends on the size and spread of the cancer. surgery is the most common first course of action, with the aim of removing the cancer cells. unlike most other cancers, chemotherapy isn’t very effective in treating kidney cancer. however, there are non-surgical treatments available, such as radiotherapy or targeted drug therapies. the main treatments for kidney cancer include:nephrectomy embolisation radiotherapy targeted therapies immunotherapy'}, {'your treatment plan': ' you can expect to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising a specialist cancer surgeon, an oncologist (who specialises in radiotherapy and\xa0chemotherapy), a radiologist, a nephrologist (a kidney specialist)

treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. when deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:the\xa0stage and grade of your cancer\xa0(how big it is and how far it’s spread) your age and general health if the cancer hasn’t spread out of your kidney (t1 or t2 kidney cancer), it can usually be cured by removing some or all of the kidney. if the cancer has spread out of your kidney (t3 or t4 kidney cancer), a complete cure may not be possible. however, it should be possible to slow the cancer’s progression and treat any symptoms.'}, {'surgical treatments': ''}, {'non-surgical treatments for advanced kidney cancer': ' kidney cancer is one of the few types of cancer that’s less responsive to\xa0chemotherapy\xa0(where powerful medication is used to kill cancerous cells). however, a number of\xa0clinical trials are underway that are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medications that appear to be benefiting some people. there are also a number of different non-surgical treatments that can slow the spread of the cancer and help control its symptoms.'}, {'targeted therapies': ' a number of\xa0new medicines have been developed for the treatment of kidney cancer. these are:sunitinib pazopanib axitinib sorafenib temsirolimus everolimus bevacizumab these medicines are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they’re designed to target and interrupt the functions needed by cancer to grow and spread. at present, only sunitinib, pazopanib and axitinib\xa0have been recommended by the\xa0national institute for health and care excellence (nice). they’re available on the nhs for people who are still relatively healthy and have advanced kidney cancer, or kidney cancer that’s spread to other parts of their body.

of kidney cancer (kinase and mtor inhibitors), there are also treatments that work by encouraging the immune system to attack cancer cells. this type of treatment is known as immunotherapy. bevacizumab is a medication that’s given intravenously (into a vein, through a drip). it blocks a protein called endothelial growth factor (vegf), which helps cancer to grow. bevacizumab is usually used in combination with\xa0an immunotherapy treatment called interferon. interferon is taken as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously), three times a week. it encourages your immune system to attack and destroy the cancer cells. another medication called aldesleukin is sometimes used to treat kidney cancer that’s spread. it’s similar to a natural protein the body produces called interleukin-2 (il-2), which is part of the immune system. il-2 activates lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which fight illnesses and infections. aldesleukin works in a number of ways. it interferes with how cancer cells grow and multiply, it stimulates the immune system into attacking cancer cells, and it makes cancer cells send out chemicals that attract immune system cells. like interferon, aldesleukin is usually given as a subcutaneous injection. immunotherapy treatments are now rarely used to treat advanced kidney cancer. this is because targeted therapies tend to be more effective in controlling the condition, and immunotherapy can sometimes cause serious side effects. the cancer research uk website has more information about\xa0treatments for advanced kidney cancer.'}, {'preventing kidney cancer': ' as the causes of kidney cancer aren’t fully understood, it’s not possible to completely prevent it. however,\xa0leading a healthy lifestyle may help

at its colour. the darker your urine is, the more concentrated it is. your urine is usually a dark yellow colour in the morning because it contains a build-up of waste products that your body has produced overnight. drinks such as tea, coffee and fruit juice can count towards your fluid intake, but water is the healthiest option and is best for preventing kidney stones developing. you should also make sure you drink more when it’s hot or when you’re exercising, to replenish fluids lost through sweating. read more about preventing dehydration.'}, {'diet': ' if your kidney stone is caused by too much calcium, you may be advised to reduce the amount of oxalates in your diet. oxalates prevent calcium being absorbed by your body, and can accumulate in your kidney to form a stone. foods

to help restore your voice. this may include an implant in your throat, or an electrical device\xa0you hold against your throat to produce sound. read more about\xa0treating laryngeal cancer\xa0and recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery.'}, {'causes of laryngeal cancer': ' laryngeal cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the larynx, although it’s not clear exactly why this happens. all cancers begin with a change in\xa0a cell’s\xa0dna.\xa0dna provides our cells with a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. a change in\xa0dna can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means cells continue to grow instead of stopping when they should. this causes the cells to reproduce in an uncontrollable manner, producing a growth of tissue called a tumour. it’s not known why the dna inside the cells of the larynx is affected in cases of laryngeal cancer. but it appears that exposure to\xa0things that can damage the cells and tissue of the larynx increases the risk of cancer developing.'}, {'what can increase your risk?': ' a\xa0number of things can increase your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.'}, {'diagnosing laryngeal cancer': ' if you have symptoms of laryngeal cancer, such as a hoarse voice and pain when swallowing, your gp will ask about your symptoms and recent medical history. they may also examine the inside and outside of your throat for abnormalities, such as lumps and swellings. if laryngeal cancer is suspected, you’ll probably be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ent) department of your local hospital for further testing. the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends that\xa0anyone aged 45\xa0or over with persistent unexplained hoarseness or an unexplained lump in their neck should have an appointment with a specialist within 2 weeks.'}, {'nasendoscopy': ' a nasendoscopy is a procedure used to get a clear view of your larynx. during the procedure, a small, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end (endoscope) is\xa0inserted into your nostril and passed down the back of your throat. the images from the endoscope are displayed on a monitor. you’ll usually be awake while this is carried out and it may feel uncomfortable.\xa0a\xa0local anaesthetic spray is\xa0sometimes used to numb your nose and throat beforehand, so you don’t feel any pain.'}, {'laryngoscopy': ' if it wasn’t possible to get a good view of your larynx during a nasendoscopy, or a possible problem is spotted, you may have a further test called a laryngoscopy. like a nasendoscopy, this procedure involves using an endoscope to examine your larynx. however, the endoscope used during a laryngoscopy is longer and inserted through the mouth. this allows the larynx to be seen in greater detail. a laryngoscopy\xa0can be very uncomfortable, so it’s usually carried out under\xa0general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep). you should be able to leave hospital as soon as you’ve recovered from the effects of anaesthetic, which is usually the same day or the day after.'}, {'biopsy': ' during a\xa0nasendoscopy or\xa0laryngoscopy, your doctor may use small instruments to remove a sample of cells from your larynx so it can be examined for signs of cancer. this is known as a\xa0biopsy. alternatively, if you have a lump in your neck, a needle and syringe can be used to\xa0remove a tissue sample. this is known as fine needle aspiration.'}, {'further testing': ' if the results of the biopsy show you have cancer and there’s a risk it may have spread, you’ll probably be referred for further testing to assess how widespread the cancer is. the tests may include:a computerised tomography (ct) scan – a series of x-rays are taken to build up a more detailed three-dimensional picture of your larynx and the surrounding tissue a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan –\xa0a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce a more detailed image of your larynx and the surrounding tissue a pet-ct scan\xa0– a ct scan is used to take pictures of the inside of your body after you’ve been injected with\xa0a mildly radioactive substance that helps to show cancerous areas more clearly an ultrasound scan\xa0–\xa0high-frequency sound waves are used to check for signs of cancer in the lymph nodes (glands found throughout the body) near the larynx'}, {'staging and grading': ' after these tests have been completed, your doctor should be able to tell you the extent of the cancer. this is known as the stage and grade of the cancer. healthcare professionals use a system called the tnm system to stage laryngeal cancer. t describes the size of the tumour, n describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and m gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.the t stage is given as a number from 1\xa0to 4 – small tumours confined to 1 part of the larynx are described as t1 tumours and large tumours that have grown into tissues outside the larynx are described as t4 the n stage is given as a number from 0\xa0to 3 – n0 means the lymph nodes are not affected, whereas stages n2 to n3 mean that 1 or more lymph nodes are affected the m stage is given as either m0 or m1 – m0 means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and m1 means that it has there are also 3 different grades\xa0(1\xa0to 3) used to describe\xa0laryngeal cancer. lower-grade cancers, such as grade 1, tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to spread.\xa0higher-grade cancers, such as grade 3,\xa0grow quickly and\xa0are more likely to spread. you can read more about the\xa0stages and grades of laryngeal cancer on the cancer research uk website.'}, {'treating laryngeal cancer': ' the treatment for laryngeal cancer largely depends on the size of the cancer. the main treatments are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy. most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) of specialists that work together to decide\xa0the best way to proceed with your treatment. members of your mdt will probably include a surgeon, a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and a specialist cancer nurse who will be responsible for co-ordinating your care. your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you’d like to ask\xa0your care team. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.'}, {'your treatment plan': ' your recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage of the\xa0cancer (see diagnosing laryngeal cancer for more information on staging). if you have early-stage laryngeal cancer, it may be possible to remove the cancer using surgery (endoscopic resection) or\xa0radiotherapy alone. this may also be the case with slightly larger cancers, although a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is sometimes required. in later-stage laryngeal cancer, more extensive surgery may be needed. radiotherapy and chemotherapy will probably be used in combination. in some cases, the entire larynx may have to be removed. a medication called cetuximab may be used in cases where chemotherapy is not suitable.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. it can be used as a treatment on its own for early-stage laryngeal cancer, or it can be used\xa0after surgery to stop cancerous cells returning. it’s sometimes combined with chemotherapy. the energy beams used during radiotherapy have to be precisely targeted to your larynx.\xa0to ensure\xa0the beams are directed at the exact area, a special plastic mask will be made to hold your head in the right position. a mould of your face will be taken so that the mask can be made before treatment starts. radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions from monday to friday, with a break from treatment at the weekend. the course of treatment usually lasts for 3 to 7 weeks. as well as killing cancerous cells, radiotherapy can affect healthy tissue and has a number of side effects, including:sore, red skin (similar to sunburn) mouth ulcers dry mouth loss of taste loss of appetite tiredness feeling sick your mdt will monitor any side effects and treat them when possible. for example, protective gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers, and medicines are available for a dry mouth. radiotherapy can sometimes cause your throat tissue to become inflamed. severe inflammation can cause breathing difficulties. contact your key worker or visit\xa0your local accident and emergency (a&e) department as soon as possible if you have difficulty breathing. most side effects should pass within a few weeks of treatment finishing. read more about\xa0radiotherapy.'}, {'surgery': ' there are 3 types of surgery that\xa0can be used to treat laryngeal cancer. they are:endoscopic resection partial laryngectomy total laryngectomy'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicines to damage the dna of the cancerous cells and stop them reproducing. it may be used to\xa0shrink a tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, or in combination with radiotherapy to make the radiotherapy more effective. it can also be used to\xa0treat laryngeal cancer that’s advanced or has come back after treatment. in this situation, it can relieve symptoms and may slow the cancer’s growth. chemotherapy medication is usually given as an injection into a vein (intravenously) once every\xa03\xa0or 4 weeks, for up to 6 months. you may need to stay in hospital for a few days\xa0during each treatment or you may just come in for a short visit each time. chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. this, unfortunately, means side effects are common, such as:feeling and being sick hair loss loss of appetite diarrhoea sore mouth and mouth ulcers tiredness chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illness. it’s therefore important to report any symptoms of potential infection to your\xa0mdt, such as a high temperature, chills or a persistent cough. you should also avoid close contact with people\xa0known to have an infection. the\xa0side effects of chemotherapy should improve after your treatment has finished. read more about\xa0chemotherapy.'}, {'cetuximab': ' cetuximab is a type of medication called biological therapy. these medications target and disrupt the processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce. cetuximab can be used in combination with radiotherapy to treat more advanced laryngeal cancer, when it’s not possible to use chemotherapy. for example, people with kidney or heart disease, or people with an ongoing infection, may not be able to have chemotherapy, because it could make them very ill. cetuximab is given slowly\xa0through a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to an hour or more. it’s usually given weekly for\xa0up to 7 weeks. side effects of cetuximab are usually mild and include:rashes feeling sick diarrhoea breathlessness cetuximab can also trigger allergic reactions in some people, which can cause problems such as a swollen tongue or throat. in a few cases,\xa0the reaction can be severe and potentially life-threatening. most serious reactions occur within a day of treatment starting, so you’ll be closely monitored once your treatment begins. if you have symptoms of a severe\xa0reaction, such as a rapid heartbeat or breathing problems, medication can be used to relieve them (such as corticosteroids).'}, {'recovering from laryngeal cancer': ' if you’ve had some or all of your larynx removed (laryngectomy), it’s likely that you’ll need to spend 1 or 2 days in an intensive care unit until you’ve recovered. you won’t be able to eat until your throat has healed, which for most people\xa0takes at least\xa0a week or two. while your throat heals, you’ll need to be fed through a tube that’s passed\xa0through your nose and into your stomach. if you’ve had all of your larynx removed\xa0(total laryngectomy), you won’t be able to speak normally, because you will no longer have vocal cords.\xa0a number of techniques can be used to replicate the functions of your vocal cords although they can take\xa0weeks or months to learn. therefore, it’s likely that you’ll need to use alternative methods of communicating, such as using a pen or paper,\xa0during the first few weeks or months after surgery. this can be a frustrating experience – the loss of something you’ve previously taken for granted can be difficult to cope with. try to prepare yourself for strangers reacting in unpredictable and possibly upsetting ways.\xa0some people who have had a laryngectomy have reported that other people sometimes assume they’re deaf or have a learning difficulty because of their inability to speak.'}, {'your emotions': ' the emotional impact of living with a laryngectomy can be significant. many people report experiencing a rollercoaster effect. for example, you may feel down when laryngeal cancer is diagnosed, then feel up after the cancer has been removed, then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the practicalities of living with a laryngectomy. these emotional changes can sometimes trigger feelings of depression. you may be depressed if you have felt very down during the past month and you no longer take pleasure in doing\xa0things you enjoy. contact your gp or care team for advice if you think\xa0you may be depressed. there are a range of effective treatments available. the\xa0national association of laryngectomee clubs (nalc) is also a useful resource for people trying to come to terms with living with a laryngectomy. nalc is a patient support group that provides advice on all aspects of living with a laryngectomy.'}, {'looking after your stoma': ' if you’ve had all of your larynx removed, the surgeon will need to create a permanent hole in your throat through which you will breathe (a stoma). during the first few months after surgery, it’s likely that your stoma will produce a lot of mucus, particularly if you’ve had radiotherapy. excessive mucus can cause breathing difficulties, so a tube may be attached to your stoma to help you breathe more easily. once the production of mucus has settled down, the tube can be removed. it’s important to clean your stoma at least once a day, otherwise it can become crusty and may become vulnerable to infection.\xa0a specialist nurse can teach you how to keep your stoma clean. you’ll be given special filters to place over your stoma that can help keep your stoma moist and free of germs. it’s important to remember that you’ll need to cover your stoma with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, rather than covering your mouth or nose. this is because mucus or saliva will come out of your stoma.'}, {'speaking after surgery': ' if your larynx has been completely removed as part of your treatment for laryngeal cancer, you’ll need additional treatment to help restore your voice. before your laryngectomy, you may meet a speech and language therapist (slt) to discuss possible treatment options for restoring your voice. an slt is a healthcare professional who specialises in helping people who have difficulties speaking and using language. there are several different treatment options.'}, {'preventing laryngeal cancer': ' it’s thought that most laryngeal cancers can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle. avoiding\xa0tobacco products, cutting down on how much alcohol you drink and\xa0having a healthy diet are particularly important in reducing your chances of developing the condition.'}, {'avoiding tobacco products': ' using tobacco products increases your chances of developing several different types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer. tobacco comes in many forms, including:cigarettes pipe tobacco cigars cigarillos snuff (powdered tobacco\xa0snorted through the nose) chewing tobacco if you smoke or use other tobacco products, stopping will have both short- and long-term health benefits, including significantly reducing your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. if you decide to stop smoking your free nhs\xa0stop smoking service\xa0can help you give up. you can also call quit your way

medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may have. read more about stopping smoking.'}, {'cutting down on alcohol': ' staying within the recommended guidelines for alcohol consumption will also reduce your risk of developing laryngeal\xa0and liver cancers. studies have found that your risk of developing laryngeal cancer reduces significantly within 5\xa0to 10 years of not drinking, and after 20\xa0to 30 years your risk is about the same as someone who has never drunk alcohol. contact your gp if you’re finding it difficult to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. you may need additional treatment, which could include counselling, group work or medication. read more about\xa0treatments for alcohol misuse\xa0and tips on cutting down how much you drink.'}, {'healthy diet': ' research shows a diet that contains plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly tomatoes, citrus fruit (such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons), olive oil and fish oil,\xa0may reduce your risk of getting laryngeal cancer. this type of diet is sometimes known as a ‘mediterranean diet’. eating plenty of fruit\xa0and vegetables each day may help to reduce your

(sle) is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. the immune system is the body’s natural defence against illness and infection. when the immune system detects the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria or a virus, it sends white blood cells and antibodies to attack it. in cases of sle, antibodies released by the immune system can attack healthy tissue, cells and organs. it’s not clear exactly why this happens, although most experts think sle has more than one cause. it has been suggested that there may be a number of genetic factors that make people more susceptible to the condition, and that it also takes one or more environmental factors to trigger sle in those who are susceptible. possible genetic and environmental factors are discussed in more detail below.'}, {'genetic factors': ' brothers and sisters of people with sle are much more likely to develop the condition than the population at large. researchers have identified a number of different genetic mutations that seem to make people more susceptible to developing sle. a genetic mutation occurs when normal instructions carried in certain genes become “scrambled”,

tissues. it can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs. other symptoms of lymphoedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them. lymphoedema can get worse if it’s not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition. read more about the symptoms of lymphoedema\xa0and diagnosing lymphoedema'}, {'what causes\xa0lymphoedema?': ' lymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. this is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues. abnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphoedema. there are two main types of lymphoedema:primary lymphoedema – caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury, cancer treatment, inflammation of the limb or a lack of limb movement read more about the\xa0causes of lymphoedema'}, {'who is affected': ' a recent study has suggested that over 200,000 people in the uk may be living with lymphoedema. secondary lymphoedema has been shown to affect approximately one in five women after breast cancer treatment. primary lymphoedema is less common than secondary lymphoedema, and is estimated to affect around one in every 6,000 people.'}, {'how lymphoedema is treated': ' there is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system. these include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques. read more about\xa0treating lymphoedema and preventing lymphoedema'}, {'complications': ' the build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection. in particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called\xa0cellulitis is commonly reported in people with the condition. read more about the\xa0complications of lymphoedema'}, {'symptoms of lymphoedema': ' the main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight. at first, the swelling may come and go. it may get worse during the day and then go down overnight. without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent. other symptoms in an affected body part can include:an aching, heavy feeling difficulty with movement repeated skin infections the skin becoming hard and tight folds developing in the skin wart-like growths developing on the skin a leakage of fluid through the skin when these symptoms start depends on what is causing the condition. if lymphoedema is caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body), the symptoms can develop at any age, but most commonly start during infancy, adolescence or early adulthood. in these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time – particularly the lower leg. if lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. for example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment for\xa0breast cancer, lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years. read more about the causes of lymphoedema'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' if you are at risk of developing lymphoedema because you have had treatment for\xa0cancer, you may be offered an assessment for the condition as part of your treatment aftercare plan. speak to your consultant or specialist nurse if you have any concerns. if you think you may have lymphoedema, but not as a result of treatment for cancer, see your gp. read more about diagnosing lymphoedema'}, {'causes of lymphoedema': ' there are two types of lymphoedema, called primary and secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes. the main causes of primary and secondary lymphoedema are outlined below.'}, {'primary lymphoedema': ' primary lymphoedema is caused by alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that help fight infection and remove excess fluid from the body). these “faulty” genes result in the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining fluid not developing properly or not working as they should. primary lymphoedema usually runs in families, but not every child born to someone with the condition will develop it themselves.'}, {'secondary lymphoedema': ' secondary lymphoedema develops in people who previously had a normal lymphatic system. it can have a number of different causes. some of the most common causes are explained below.'}, {'diagnosing lymphoedema': ' if you’re being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you’ll be monitored for the condition afterwards. otherwise, see your gp if you experience symptoms of swelling. there are a number of specialist lymphoedema treatment centres in the uk. your doctor may refer you to one of these for further assessment. a list of treatment centres near you is available from the lymphoedema support network. in many cases, it’s possible to make a diagnosis of lymphoedema by:asking about your symptoms and medical history examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it’s enlarged'}, {'further tests': ' although not necessary in most cases, further tests may occasionally be used to assess and monitor your condition. these tests are explained below.'}, {'treating lymphoedema': ' the recommended treatment for lymphoedema is decongestive lymphatic therapy (dlt). dlt is not a cure for lymphoedema, but it can help control the symptoms. although it takes time and effort, the treatment can be used to effectively control your lymphoedema.'}, {'decongestive lymphatic therapy (dlt)': ' there are four components to dlt:compression bandages and garments – to move fluid out of the affected limb and minimise further build-up skin care – to keep the skin in good condition and reduce the chances of infection exercises – to use muscles in the affected limb to improve lymph drainage specialised massage techniques – known as manual lymphatic drainage (mld) – to stimulate the flow of fluid in the lymphatic system and reduce swelling each of these components is described in more detail below. dlt usually begins with an intensive phase of therapy, during which you may receive daily treatment for several weeks to help reduce the volume of the affected body part. this is followed by the second phase, known as the maintenance phase. during this, you will be encouraged to take over your own care by carrying out simple self-massage techniques, wearing compression garments and continuing to exercise. this phase of treatment aims to maintain the reduced size of the affected body part. you may then have reviews every few months to check how your treatment is progressing.'}, {'surgery': ' in a small number of cases, surgery may be considered to treat lymphoedema. there are three main types of surgery that may be useful for the condition:the removal of sections of excess skin and underlying tissue (debulking) the removal of fat from the affected limb (liposuction) – see below the restoration of the flow of fluid around the affected section of the lymphatic system – for example, by connecting the lymphatic system to nearby blood vessels (lymphaticovenular anastomosis) these treatments may help to reduce the size of areas of the body affected by lymphoedema, but some are still experimental – particularly lymphaticovenular anastomosis – and are not in widespread use.'}, {'complications of lymphoedema': ' cellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema, but psychological issues can also occur as a result of the condition. these complications are explained below.'}, {'cellulitis': ' many people with lymphoedema experience repeated episodes of\xa0cellulitis (also known as erysipelas). cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) and the layer of fat and soft tissues (the subcutaneous tissues) that lie underneath the skin. cellulitis can occur as a result of lymphoedema and can also cause the condition. symptoms of cellulitis can include:redness and a feeling of heat in the skin pain in the affected area a high temperature (fever) chills cellulitis can usually be successfully treated with antibiotics, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital. in some cases, you may be provided with a short supply of antibiotic tablets to use as soon as you notice symptoms of cellulitis. alternatively, you may be given a long-term course of antibiotics to take to prevent infection.'}, {'psychological impact': ' living with a chronic (long-term) condition that affects your appearance, such as lymphoedema, can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of depression. if you have been feeling particularly down for the last few months and you no longer take pleasure in the things you usually enjoy, you may be depressed. if this is the case, talk to your gp or members of your lymphoedema treatment team, because there are effective treatments for depression. talking to other people who also have lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety. the\xa0lymphoedema support network offers information and advice, and can put you in touch with a support group in your area. remember: if you persevere with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable. read more about\xa0treating lymphoedema'}, {'preventing lymphoedema': ' it’s not possible to completely prevent lymphoedema, but the following steps may help reduce your chances of developing the condition. if you already have lymphoedema, this advice may stop it getting worse.'}, {'skin care': ' the part of your body affected by lymphoedema is more vulnerable to infection of the build-up of fluid within the tissues. any cuts in your skin can allow bacteria to enter your body and may quickly develop into an infection. skin infections can also damage your lymphatic system and cause lymphoedema to develop. you can reduce your chances of developing skin infections by:not having injections or blood pressure readings in the affected area whenever possible treating cuts and scratches immediately with an antiseptic cream using insect repellents to prevent\xa0insect bites moisturising the skin daily to keep it supple – your gp can prescribe a suitable cream avoiding very hot baths and showers – the heat from saunas, steam rooms and sun beds may also increase the swelling using sun cream with a high sun protection factor (spf) to prevent sunburn wearing gloves for gardening and household tasks to avoid cuts, if your upper limbs are affected using anti-fungal powder to prevent fungal infections in your skin or feet, if your lower limbs are affected cutting your nails with nail clippers seeing a chiropodist for foot and nail care – but make sure you tell them you have lymphoedema wearing shoes that fit correctly and provide support on the top of your feet, if your lower limbs are affected using an electric razor if you need to shave to reduce the risk of cutting yourself not wearing tight-fitting clothes or jewellery contact your gp as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of a possible skin infection, such as redness and a feeling of heat in the skin.'}, {'healthy lifestyle': ' adopting a healthy lifestyle may also help reduce your risk of developing lymphoedema, and may help control the

you’re travelling to areas where there’s a high risk of the disease. this means that you can get medical attention quickly. symptoms are similar to those of flu and usually appear 6 to 30 days after the mosquito bite, but it can sometimes take up to a year for symptoms to start. the initial symptoms of malaria include:a high temperature (fever) headache sweats chills muscle aches or pains vomiting and or diarrhoea these symptoms can start mild and may be difficult to identify as malaria.'}, {'when to seek medical attention': ' malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. it can be fatal if not treated quickly. the effects of malaria are usually more severe in:babies young children pregnant women older people'}, {'what causes malaria?': ' malaria is caused by the plasmodium parasite. the parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. there are 5 different types of plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. they are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be. all malaria infections cause the same symptoms and require immediate medical attention. it’s not possible to find out which type of malaria you have from symptoms alone.'}, {'how malaria is spread': ' the plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. these are known as ‘night-biting’ mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise. when a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. malaria can’t be spread directly from person to person. when an infected mosquito bites, the parasite enters the blood and travels to the liver. in the liver, it develops for days to weeks before re-entering the blood. this is the point where symptoms develop and urgent treatment is required. although it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection through blood transfusions\xa0and sharing needles.'}, {'where is malaria found?': ' malaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. it is not found in the uk or europe. the fitfortravel website has more information about the risk of malaria in individual countries.'}, {'complications of malaria': ' malaria is a serious illness that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated quickly. severe complications of malaria can occur within hours or days of the first symptoms. this means it is important to seek urgent medical help as soon as possible.'}, {'other complications': ' other complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include:liver failure and jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes shock – a sudden drop in blood pressure pulmonary oedema – a build-up of fluid in the lungs acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) abnormally low blood sugar – hypoglycaemia kidney failure swelling and rupturing of the spleen

of pregnancy low birth weight restricted growth of the baby in the womb stillbirth miscarriage death of the mother pregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to regions with a risk of malaria.'}, {'preventing and treating malaria': ' if you travel to an area that has malaria, you are at risk of the infection. it’s very important that you take precautions to prevent the disease and get treatment immediately if symptoms do develop.'}, {'preventing malaria': ' malaria can often be avoided using the abcd approach to prevention, which stands for:awareness of risk – find out whether you’re at risk of getting malaria bite prevention – use insect repellent, cover your skin with clothing, and use a mosquito net to avoid mosquito bites check whether you need to take antimalarial prevention tablets by visiting a travel health clinic – if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose and finish the course diagnosis – seek immediate medical advice

malaria infection. for the best protection, you must also follow mosquito bite prevention advice. you must start taking antimalarial tablets before travel and continue taking them whilst travelling in the risk area. antimalarial tablets must also be taken for a period of time after you have left the risk area. how long antimalarial tablets should be taken will depend on which tablet is used. antimalarial tablets don’t stop malaria from entering your body. however, they do stop the infection from developing inside your body and prevent you from getting ill. if you stop taking your antimalarial tablets early (even when you are back in the uk) you could still become ill with malaria.'}, {'taking antimalarial medication': ' you may need to take a short trial course of antimalarial tablets before travelling. this is to check that side effects do not occur and that you do not have an adverse reaction. if you do, alternative antimalarials can be prescribed before you leave. there’s currently no vaccine available that offers protection against malaria.'}, {'types of antimalarial medication': ' the type of antimalarial tablets that you will be recommended is based on the

way, but is\xa0only recommended if\xa090% or more of the tumour has been\xa0removed the side effects of chemotherapy largely depend on the specific medication you’re taking. common general side effects include tiredness, headaches, temporary hair loss and nausea. read more about the side effects of chemotherapy. for more information about some of the treatments used, see the guidelines from the\xa0national institute for health and care excellence (nice) on carmustine implants to treat gliomas\xa0and temozolomide for recurrent malignant glioma.'}, {'radiosurgery': ' stereotactic radiosurgery (srs)\xa0is a special type of radiotherapy that’s sometimes used to treat brain tumours that can’t be safely removed with surgery. during the treatment, several small beams of radiation are used to very accurately\xa0deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumour,\xa0usually in a single treatment session. as the radiation beams can be aimed very precisely, a high dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumour with minimal damage to the surrounding healthy cells. this means you’re less likely to experience many of the usual side effects of radiotherapy. recovery\xa0tends to be much faster\xa0and an overnight stay isn’t usually\xa0necessary. however, radiosurgery is currently only available in a few specialised centres across the uk and is only suitable for certain people, based on the characteristics of their tumour.'}, {'treating symptoms': ' you may also be given medication to relieve some of the symptoms you may\xa0have as a result of your\xa0brain tumour. these may include:anticonvulsants to prevent seizures (fits) corticosteroids to reduce\xa0swelling and pressure in the brain painkillers to treat\xa0headaches anti-emetics to prevent vomiting depending on your circumstances, these medications may be given before, after, or instead of surgery.'}, {'choosing not to have treatment': ' if your tumour is at an advanced stage or in a difficult place in the brain, a cure may not be possible and treatment may only be able to control the cancer for a period of time. this means you will be getting the side effects of treatment without getting rid of the tumour. in this situation, it may be difficult to decide whether or not to go ahead with treatment. talk to your doctor about what will happen if you choose not to be treated, so you can make an informed decision. if you decide not to have treatment, you will still be given palliative care, which will control your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.'}, {'recovering from malignant brain tumours': ' after being treated for a brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems.'}, {'follow-up appointments': ' malignant\xa0brain tumours often grow back after treatment, so regular follow-up appointments will be recommended to look for signs that this may have happened. these appointments may include a discussion of any worrying new symptoms you experience, a physical examination, and\xa0occasionally a brain scan. you will\xa0usually\xa0have follow-up appointments at least every few months to begin with, but they may be needed less frequently over time if no problems develop.'}, {'supportive treatment': ' problems caused by a brain tumour\xa0don’t always resolve as soon as\xa0the tumour is removed or treated. for example, some people have persistent weakness, seizures (fits), difficulty walking and speech problems. in these cases,\xa0you may need\xa0extra support to help you overcome or adapt to\xa0any problems you have. this may include\xa0therapies such as:physiotherapy\xa0– to help with any movement problems you have occupational therapy – to identify any problems you’re having with daily activities and\xa0arrange for\xa0any equipment or alterations to your home that may help speech therapy – to help you with any\xa0communication or swallowing problems some people may also need to continue taking medication for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed. the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has made recommendations on the standards of care that brain tumour patients should receive. for more information, see the\xa0service guidance for improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.'}, {'driving\xa0and

scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive again once an agreed period has passed and you have successfully completed a medical test to determine your ability to control a vehicle. you can find out about\xa0brain tumours and driving on the cancer research uk website. flying is usually possible from 3 months after treatment.'}, {'sports and activities': ' after you have been treated for a brain tumour, you must permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing. you can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered. swimming unsupervised is not recommended for around 1 year after treatment, as there is a risk you could have an\xa0epileptic fit while in the water.'}, {'sex and pregnancy': ' it’s safe to have sex after treatment for a brain tumour. women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment.\xa0if you’re planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.'}, {'going back to work': ' you’ll usually tire\xa0more easily following treatment for a brain tumour. you may wish to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, but it’s probably a good idea to return part-time to begin with and only go back full-time when you feel able to. if you’ve experienced seizures,\xa0you shouldn’t\xa0work with machinery or at heights.'}, {'emotional support': ' a brain tumour is often life-changing. you may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained. if it will help, your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker and counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis. there are also many organisations that can\xa0provide information and support, such as\xa0the brain tumour charity and brain tumour research.'}, {'social support': ' if you have been diagnosed with a brain tumour, your treatment and medical care will probably be the first thing on your mind. but there are other aspects of your life to think about and it is important to know exactly what kind of assistance is available and where you can get it. if you are finding it hard to cope with day-to-day life, talk about your needs with your doctor or nurse, who will refer you to a social worker. your social worker will assess exactly the kind of help you need. help you may need might include:a care

will need further tests to check what stage it has reached. if the cancer is diagnosed late it can have spread from your mouth into the lymphatic system – a series of glands throughout your body which produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system. once the cancer reaches the lymphatic system, it is capable of spreading to any other part of your body, including your bones, blood and organs. however, it’s uncommon for mouth cancer to spread further than the lymph nodes near your mouth, although in some cases it may also spread to surrounding bones, such as the jaw bone, and in some cases your lungs. therefore, the tests will examine your lymph nodes, bones and the tissue near the site of your initial tumour to check for the presence of other tumours. these tests may

but most of them will pass once the radiotherapy is complete.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning. chemotherapy involves the use of powerful cancer-killing medicines. these medicines damage the dna of the cancerous cells, interrupting their ability to reproduce. medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. adverse side effects are common and include:fatigue (tiredness) sore mouth mouth ulcers feeling sick being sick hair loss tiredness the side effects should stop once the treatment has finished. chemotherapy also weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to infection.'}, {'cetuximab': ' cetuximab is a new type of medication, known as a biologic, used to treat advanced cases of mouth cancer. it is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. cetuximab targets proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors. these receptors help the cancer to grow, so by targeting these proteins, cetuximab prevents the cancer from spreading. the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) ruled that cetuximab did not represent a cost-effective treatment in most cases and has recommended it only be used in people who:are in a good state of health (likely to make a good recovery if treated) are unable to have chemotherapy for medical reasons (for example, because they have kidney disease or are pregnant)'}, {'complications of mouth cancer': ' complications of treatment for mouth cancer can include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), speech problems and emotional disruption.'}, {'difficulty swallowing': ' dysphagia\xa0is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. it’s easy to take your ability to swallow food and liquid\xa0for granted,\xa0but in reality, the process relies on a complex interaction of muscles, which can be easily disrupted. surgery and\xa0radiotherapy can affect your tongue, mouth or throat, resulting in dysphagia. dysphagia is a potentially serious problem because, aside from the risk of malnutrition, there is a chance that small particles of food could enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs. this can trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia. if you are having problems swallowing, a speech and language therapist (slt) will need to assess your swallowing reflex. one way an slt can do this is to perform a test known as a videofluoroscopy, which involves adding a special dye to liquid and food that you swallow. the dye highlights your swallowing reflexes and by using x-rays your slt can see if there is a risk of food entering your lungs. if this is the case, it may be necessary for the short term to provide you with a feeding tube, which will be directly connected to your stomach. the slt will teach you exercises so you can ‘relearn’ how to swallow properly. your ability to swallow will improve as you learn the exercises and the damaged tissue is allowed to heal. however, there is a chance your swallowing reflex will never fully recover. in some circumstances, you may have to alter your diet to make swallowing easier. a\xa0dietitian can give you dietary advice. read more detailed information about how dysphagia is\xa0treated'}, {'speech': ' much like swallowing, your ability to speak clearly is governed by a complex interaction of muscles, bones and tissue, including your tongue, teeth, lips and soft palate (a section of tissue found at the back of the mouth). radiotherapy and surgery can affect this process and make it difficult to pronounce certain sounds. in severe cases, you may have problems making yourself understood. an slt will help you improve your verbal communication skills by teaching you a series of exercises that develop your range of vocal movements and teach you new ways of producing sounds.'}, {'emotional impact': ' the emotional impact of living with mouth cancer can be significant. many people report experiencing a roller coaster effect. for example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel up when\xa0the cancer responds to treatment.\xa0then you may feel down again as you try to come to terms with the side effects and after effects of your treatment. this type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression. signs that you may be depressed include:feeling down or hopeless during the past month no longer taking pleasure in the things you used to enjoy contact your gp for advice if you think\xa0you may be depressed. there are a range of effective treatments for depression, including antidepressant medication and talking therapies, such as\xa0cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt). read more about\xa0depression and coping with cancer'}, {'living with mouth cancer': ' having mouth cancer doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to give up work, but you may need quite a lot of time off, and you may not be able to carry on as you did before treatment. if you have cancer you’re covered by the disability discrimination act. this means that your employer is not allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. they have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope. examples of these include:allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform or your working environment the definition of what is ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation. for example, how much it would affect your employer’s business. it will help if you give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you will need off and when.

persistent dull ache,\xa0which may be made worse by movement.'}, {'bone fractures and spinal cord compression': ' multiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). the spine and ribs are most often affected. fractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back). compression of the spinal cord can cause\xa0pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels.'}, {'anaemia': ' multiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells (anaemia). this can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment. if you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless.'}, {'repeated infections': ' people with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). you may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time.'}, {'raised calcium levels in the blood': ' a high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream.

treating multiple myeloma'}, {'causes of multiple myeloma': ' in multiple myeloma, cells inside the bone marrow called plasma cells become cancerous. bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. it produces the body’s blood cells. plasma cells are normally produced in\xa0a controlled way. in cases of multiple myeloma, large numbers of abnormal plasma cells are produced. these fill up the bone marrow and interfere with the production of other cells, such as red and white blood cells. the exact reason why this happens is unknown, but multiple myeloma is closely associated with a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (mgus), and there are certain things that can increase your risk of developing it.'}, {'monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (mgus)': ' in almost all cases, multiple myeloma occurs in someone who previously had mgus. mgus is the name for having an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood. this does not cause any symptoms and treatment is not required. however, every year around\xa01 in every 100 people with mgus go on to develop multiple myeloma. there is no known way to delay or prevent this, so\xa0ongoing outpatient\xa0tests to check for cancer will usually be recommended if you have mgus.'}, {'other factors': ' as well as mgus, certain things can increase your risk of developing multiple myeloma, including:age – your risk of developing multiple myeloma increases as you get older; most cases are diagnosed at around the age of\xa070, and cases affecting people under 40 are rare gender – men are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than women ethnicity – multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and asian populations it has also been suggested that having a family history of mgus or multiple myeloma, having reduced immunity (for example, because of medication or hiv), being overweight or obese, and being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals may increase your risk of multiple myeloma. however, a link between these factors and the condition is less clear.'}, {'diagnosing multiple myeloma': ' multiple myeloma can be difficult to diagnose because it’s an uncommon type of cancer that initially has few or no symptoms. your gp will examine you and ask about your symptoms, medical history and overall health. during the examination, your gp will look for things such as bleeding, signs of infection and specific areas of bone tenderness. you may need urine and\xa0blood tests to check for certain types of antibodies and proteins (immunoglobulins). if multiple myeloma is suspected,\xa0you\xa0will be\xa0referred to a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the blood) for further tests and\xa0scans.'}, {'blood tests': ' a number of blood tests are used to help diagnose multiple myeloma, and they may need to be repeated to monitor the condition. these may include:erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) or plasma viscosity (pv) –\xa0if you have multiple myeloma, your esr or pv will usually be raised tests to measure the type and number of abnormal antibodies produced by the cancerous plasma cells a full blood count (fbc) to check levels of different types of blood cells\xa0– your doctor will be looking for a low number of red blood cells and platelets liver and kidney function blood calcium level'}, {'urine tests': ' a urine sample will be checked for the abnormal proteins produced by the cancerous plasma cells. the abnormal proteins are known as monoclonal light chains,\xa0or bence jones protein. these proteins can damage your kidneys as they pass through them from your blood to your urine. you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. this will be used to check the quantity of proteins being produced and how well your kidneys are working.'}, {'x-rays and other scans': ' you will have\xa0x-rays\xa0taken of your long bones (arms and legs), skull, spine and pelvis to look for any damage. other scans, such as\xa0computerised tomography (ct) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans, may also be carried out.'}, {'bone marrow biopsy': ' a bone marrow\xa0biopsy is usually needed to confirm multiple myeloma. a needle will be used to take a small sample of bone marrow from one of your bones, usually the pelvis. a sample of bone may also be removed. this is carried out using a\xa0local anaesthetic\xa0(the area where the needle is inserted is numbed). the sample of bone marrow and bone will be used\xa0to check for cancerous plasma cells.'}, {'treating multiple myeloma': ' if you have multiple myeloma, you will be cared for by a team, which is usually led by a consultant haematologist who specialises in myeloma. the team will discuss your condition and recommend the best treatment for you. however, the final decision will be yours. before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, it may be useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a particular treatment. there are 2 main aims in treating multiple myeloma:to bring the myeloma under control to prevent and treat problems associated with myeloma, such as\xa0anaemia and bone pain while treatment can often control myeloma and improve quality of life, myeloma usually can’t be cured. this means additional treatment is needed when the cancer comes back (a relapse). not everyone diagnosed with myeloma will need immediate treatment if the condition is not causing any problems. this is sometimes referred to as asymptomatic, or smouldering myeloma. if you don’t need treatment, you’ll be monitored for signs the cancer is beginning to cause problems. if you do need treatment, the following options are most commonly used.'}, {'bringing myeloma under\xa0control': ' the initial treatment for multiple myeloma may be either:non-intensive – for older or less fit patients (this is more common) intensive – for younger or fitter patients (thought to be too toxic for older or less fit patients) the decision about which treatment is appropriate for you is usually based on your biological age or fitness. as a general rule, people younger than 65 are more likely to be candidates for intensive therapy. for those over 70, non-intensive treatment is more likely to be recommended. those aged in between will be given careful consideration as to what treatment group they fall into. both non-intensive and intensive treatments involve taking a combination of anti-myeloma medicines. intensive treatment involves much higher doses and is followed by a stem cell transplant. the medicines usually include a chemotherapy medicine, a steroid medicine, and either thalidomide or bortezomib.'}, {'treating relapses': ' further treatment is needed if myeloma returns. treatment for relapses is generally similar to initial treatment, although non-intensive treatment is often preferred to further intensive treatment. additional medications such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide and other chemotherapy medicines may be added, or used\xa0again as your haematologist feels is appropriate. you may also be asked if you want to participate in clinical trial research into\xa0new treatments for multiple myeloma.'}, {'treating symptoms and complications of myeloma': ' as well as the main treatments for multiple myeloma, you may also need treatment to help relieve some of the problems caused by the condition. for example:painkillers – may be given to reduce pain radiotherapy\xa0– may be used to relieve bone pain\xa0or help healing after a bone is surgically repaired bisphosphonate medication – either\xa0given as tablets or by injection, this may\xa0help prevent bone damage and reduce the levels of calcium in your blood blood transfusions or\xa0erythropoietin medication – may be used\xa0to increase your red blood cell count and\xa0treat anaemia surgery – may be carried out\xa0to repair or strengthen damaged bones, or treat compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back) dialysis\xa0– may be\xa0required if you develop kidney failure plasma exchange\xa0– treatment to remove and replace a blood component called plasma may be carried out if you have unusually thick blood (hyperviscosity) these treatments can each cause side effects and complications, so make sure you discuss the potential risks and benefits with your treatment team beforehand.'}, {'clinical trials and research': ' research is ongoing to find new treatments for multiple myeloma and work out ways to improve the use of existing ones. to help with this, you may be asked to take part in a clinical trial\xa0during your treatment. clinical trials usually involve comparing a new treatment with an existing one to see whether the new treatment is more or less effective. it’s important to remember, however, that if you are given a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing treatment. there will never be

munchausen’s syndrome,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/munchausens-syndrome/,"[{'introduction': ' munchausen’s syndrome is a rare psychological and behavioural condition in which somebody fabricates or induces symptoms of illness in themselves. munchausen’s syndrome is named after a german aristocrat, baron munchausen, who became famous for telling wild, unbelievable tales about his exploits and past. people with munchausen’s syndrome typically display a set pattern of behaviour. this pattern includes:lying about their symptoms and typically also lying about other aspects of their life, such as their past or level of education manipulating test results to suggest the presence of symptoms, such as adding blood to urine samples actually inflicting symptoms on themselves, such as poisoning themselves with an overdose of medication, and travelling from hospital to hospital in different parts of the country, and seeing many different doctors munchausen’s syndrome differs from two, more common, types of feigned illness, hypochondria and malingering. people who have hypochondria actually believe they are ill, but do not manipulate test results. people who malinger pretend to be ill to gain some sort of benefit, such as avoiding military duty or trying to obtain compensation. people with munchausen’s syndrome know they’re making their symptoms up and can be highly manipulative, but their behaviour brings them no obvious benefit. instead, they often undergo painful and sometimes life-threatening surgery, even though they know it is unnecessary.'}, {'how common is munchausen’s syndrome?': ' it is hard to estimate how many people are affected by munchausen’s syndrome. they tend to be highly secretive and often use a number of false identities. once their deception is uncovered they discharge themselves from hospital and move to another area. the condition is thought to be most common in white men aged between 30 and 50. it is unclear why this is the case. the causes of munchausen’s syndrome are largely unknown. most people who have been diagnosed with the condition refuse to accept any sort of psychiatric treatment so little is known about their motives or thought processes. there is a variant of munchausen’s syndrome, called munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which an individual fabricates or induces illness in a person under their care, typically a child.'}, {'symptoms': ' warning signs that somebody may have munchausen’s syndrome include:frequent visits to hospitals in different areas claiming to have a history of complex and serious medical conditions, yet there is little documentary evidence to support this; a common ruse is for people to claim they have spent a long time out of the country symptoms that do not correspond to the results of tests symptoms that get worse for no apparent reason the person has a extremely good medical knowledge the person receives very few, or no, visitors in hospital; many people with munchausen’s syndrome adopt a solitary lifestyle and have little contact with any friends of family a willingness to undergo often painful or dangerous tests and procedures if confronted about their behaviour, they can become aggressive and will try to leave the hospital'}, {'patterns of behaviour in munchausen’s syndrome': ' there are four main ways in which people with munchausen’s syndrome can feign or induce illnesses, which are outlined below:lying about symptoms – often they choose symptoms that are hard to disprove, such as having severe headaches or they may pretend to have a seizure or pass out tampering with test results – such as heating thermometers to suggest fever or adding blood to urine samples self-infliction – they may cut or burn themselves, poison themselves with drugs or an overdose of medication, or eat food that has been contaminated with bacteria aggravate pre-existing conditions – such as rubbing dirt or dog faeces into wounds to cause an infection, or reopen previously healed wounds'}, {'causes': ' as most people with munchausen’s syndrome refuse to co-operate with any sort of psychiatric treatment or psychological profiling, there is little available evidence on the possible causes of the condition. there is a consensus of opinion that munchausen’s syndrome is a type of personality disorder. personality disorders are a class of mental health conditions in which an individual has a distorted pattern of thoughts and beliefs about themselves and others which lead them to behave in ways most people would regard as disturbed and abnormal. one theory is that people with munchausen’s syndrome have an anti-social personality disorder which causes them to take pleasure in manipulating and deceiving doctors. they may see a doctor as a figure of authority, so tricking these figures of authority, gives them a sense of power and control. another theory is that munchausen’s syndrome is an attempt to form relationships and become more socially acceptable. many people with munchausen’s syndrome are ‘loners’, have little contact with their family, and have few friends. so they then take comfort in adopting the role of a patient, and find the doctor/patient relationship provides a much needed source of human contact and emotional warmth. many people with munchausen’s syndrome have claimed to have experienced physical and sexual abuse during childhood. though due to their tendency to lie about their past, it is hard to say whether this is actually true in all cases.'}, {'diagnosis': ' diagnosing munchausen’s syndrome can be very challenging for medical professionals. people with the condition are often accomplished liars and are skilled at manipulating and exploiting a doctor’s concern for their patient, and the doctor’s natural curiosity in investigating unusual medical conditions. if a health professional does suspect a person may have munchausen’s syndrome they will usually make a detailed study of that person’s health records to look for any inconsistencies between their claimed and actual medical history. they may also attempt to talk to their family and friends to see if their claims about their past are true. health professionals can also run a number of clinical tests to check for evidence of self-inflicted illness or tampering of clinical test. for example, the person’s blood can be checked for traces of medication that the person should not be taking, but which could explain their symptoms. doctors will also want to rule out other possible motivations for their behaviour, such as faking illness for financial gain, or because they want access to strong painkillers. a diagnosis of munchausen’s syndrome can usually be confidently made if there is:clear evidence of fabricating or inducing symptoms the person prime motivation is to be seen as sick there is no other likely reason or explanation for their behaviour'}, {'treatment': ' as mentioned, treating munchausen’s syndrome can be very difficult as most people with the condition will refuse to admit they have a problem and will not co-operate with suggested treatment plans. because of this, some experts have suggested that health professionals adopt a gentle, non-confrontational approach. so rather than directly accuse a person of lying, they may gently suggest that they have complex health needs that may benefit from a referral to a psychiatrist. still, even with this approach, many people refuse, or simply move to another area. for people who do admit they have a problem, and co-operate with treatment, it may be possible to help them control the symptoms of munchausen’s syndrome. there is no standard treatment for the condition, but a combination of psychoanalysis and cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt)\xa0has proved relatively successful in helping people control their symptoms. psychoanalysis is a type of psychotherapy that is based on the theories of sigmund freud. freud suggested that unconscious beliefs or motivations, often formed during early childhood, can lay at the root of many psychological conditions. psychoanalysis attempts to uncover and then resolve these unconscious beliefs and motivations. cbt works by helping people to identify any unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns they may have. the therapist then shows them ways in which they can replace these beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been

through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. in non-hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). the affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. the most common symptom of non-hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. read more about the symptoms of non-hodgkin lymphoma.'}, {'who’s affected?': '

be put into one of 2 broad categories:high-grade or aggressive non-hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively low-grade or indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years the outlook\xa0for non-hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type,\xa0grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person’s age. low-grade tumours don’t necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. high-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond

bruising more easily if you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells. other possible side effects of chemotherapy include:nausea and vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes hair loss infertility, which may be temporary or permanent

and stimulate the immune system to attack and kill the cells. they’re often given in combination with chemotherapy to make the treatment more effective. for some types of non-hodgkin lymphoma, you may continue having monoclonal antibody treatment regularly for up to 2 years after initial treatment, in combination with\xa0chemotherapy. this can reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the future. one of the main\xa0monoclonal antibody medications used to treat non-hodgkin lymphoma is called rituximab.\xa0this medication\xa0is administered directly into your vein over the course of a few hours. side effects of rituximab can include:flu-like symptoms, such as\xa0headaches, fever and chills tiredness nausea an itchy rash you may be given additional medication to prevent or lessen these side effects. side effects should improve over time, as your body gets used to rituximab. as\xa0rituximab has been so successful in treating non-hodgkin lymphoma, scientists are working hard to make more monoclonal antibody treatments for lymphoma, and some of these are already at an advanced stage in clinical trials. you may be asked if you want to participate in one of these trials during your treatment.'}, {'steroid medication': ' steroid medication is commonly\xa0used in combination with chemotherapy to treat non-hodgkin lymphoma. this is because research has shown that using steroids makes the chemotherapy more effective. the steroid medication is normally\xa0given as tablets, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. a short course of steroids, lasting no more than a few months, is usually recommended, as this limits the number of side effects you could have. common side effects of short-term steroid use include:increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain indigestion problems sleeping feeling agitated on rare occasions, you may have to take steroids on a long-term basis. side effects of long-term steroid use include weight gain and swelling in your hands, feet and eyelids. the side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.'}, {'follow-up': ' after your course of treatment ends, you may have a repeat scan to see how well the treatment has worked. following this, you’ll need regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning (known as a ‘relapse’). these

more severe while you’re being treated. however, your immune system will usually recover in the months and years after treatment. if you have a weak immune system, you’re more vulnerable to infections, and there’s an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. in some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections occurring. it’s also important to report any symptoms of an infection to your gp or care team immediately, because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications.\xa0this is particularly

to try for a baby afterwards.'}, {'second cancers': ' having treatment for non-hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. this is known as a ‘second cancer’. the risk of getting cancer is particularly increased after cancer treatment because chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage healthy cells, as well as cancer cells. this damage can then cause the affected cells to become cancerous many years after treatment. you can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise. you should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your gp at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you’re invited

health in relation to their weight can be classified, but the most widely used method is body mass index (bmi). bmi is a measure of whether you’re a healthy weight for your height. you can use the bmi healthy weight chart\xa0to work out your\xa0score. for most adults, a bmi of:18.5 to 24.9 means you’re a healthy weight 25 to 29.9 means you’re overweight 30 to 39.9 means you’re obese 40 or above means you’re severely obese bmi isn’t used to definitively diagnose obesity, because people who are very muscular sometimes have a high bmi without excess fat.\xa0but for most people, bmi is a useful indication of whether they’re a healthy weight, overweight or obese. a better measure of excess fat is waist circumference, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweight (with a bmi of 25 to 29.9) or moderately obese (with a bmi of 30 to 34.9). generally, men with a waist circumference of 94cm (37in) or more and women with a waist circumference of 80cm (about 31.5in) or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems. read more about diagnosing obesity'}, {'risks of obesity': ' it’s very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing\xa0obvious physical changes, it\xa0can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease some types of cancer, such as\xa0breast cancer and\xa0bowel cancer stroke obesity can also affect your quality of life and lead to psychological problems, such as depression\xa0and\xa0low self-esteem (see below for more information about the health problems associated with obesity).'}, {'causes of obesity': ' obesity is generally caused by consuming more calories – particularly those in fatty and sugary foods – than you burn off through physical activity.\xa0the excess energy is stored by the body as fat. obesity is an increasingly common problem because for many people modern living involves eating excessive amounts of cheap, high-calorie food and spending a lot of time sitting down, at desks, on sofas or in cars. there are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these type of conditions don’t usually cause weight problems if they’re effectively controlled with medication. read more about the causes of obesity'}, {'treating obesity': ' the best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly. to do this you should:eat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your gp or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian) join a local weight loss group take up activities such as fast walking, jogging,\xa0swimming or tennis for 150 to 300\xa0minutes (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week eat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeat you may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating. if lifestyle changes alone don’t help you lose weight, a medication called orlistat may be recommended. if taken correctly, this medication works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. your gp will know whether orlistat is suitable for you. in rare cases, weight loss surgery\xa0may be recommended. read more about\xa0how obesity is treated'}, {'other obesity-related problems': ' obesity can\xa0cause a\xa0number of further problems, including difficulties with daily

joint and\xa0back pain low confidence and self-esteem feeling isolated the psychological problems associated with being obese can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression.'}, {'outlook': ' there’s no “quick fix” for obesity. weight loss programmes take time and commitment, and work best when fully completed. the healthcare professionals involved with your care should provide encouragement and advice about how to maintain the weight loss achieved. regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals and involving your friends and family with your attempts to lose weight\xa0can also help. remember that even losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.'}, {'causes of obesity': ' obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little. if you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don’t burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat.'}, {'calories': ' the energy value of food is measured in units called calories. the average physically active man needs about 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and the average physically active woman needs about 2,000 calories a day. this amount of calories may sound high, but it can be easy to reach if you eat certain types of food. for example, eating a large takeaway hamburger, fries and a milkshake can total 1,500 calories – and that’s just one meal. another problem is that many people aren’t physically active, so lots of the calories they consume end up being stored in their body as fat.'}, {'poor diet': ' obesity doesn’t happen overnight. it develops gradually over time, as a result of poor diet and lifestyle choices, such as:eating large amounts of processed or fast food – that’s high in fat and sugar drinking too much\xa0alcohol –\xa0alcohol contains a lot of calories, and people who drink heavily are often overweight eating out a lot –\xa0you may be tempted to also have a starter or dessert in a restaurant, and the food can be higher in fat and sugar eating larger portions than you need –\xa0you may be encouraged to eat too much if your friends or relatives are also eating large portions drinking too many sugary drinks – including soft drinks and fruit juice comfort eating –\xa0if you have low self-esteem or feel depressed, you may eat to make yourself feel better unhealthy eating habits tend to run in families. you may learn bad eating habits from your parents when you’re young and continue them into adulthood. read more about eating well'}, {'lack of physical activity': ' lack of physical activity is another important factor related to obesity. many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk for most of the day. they also rely on their cars, rather than\xa0walking or cycling. for\xa0relaxation, many people tend to watch tv, browse the internet or play computer games, and rarely take regular exercise. if you’re not active enough, you don’t use the energy provided by the food you eat, and the extra energy you consume is stored by the body as fat. the department of health recommends that adults do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. this doesn’t need to be done all\xa0in one go, but can be broken down into smaller periods. for example, you could exercise for 30 minutes a day for five days a week. if you’re obese and trying to lose weight, you may need to do more exercise than this. it may help to start off slowly and gradually increase the amount of exercise you do each week. read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults'}, {'genetics': ' some people claim\xa0there’s no point trying to lose weight because “it runs in my family” or “it’s in my genes”. while there are some rare genetic conditions that can cause obesity, such as\xa0prader-willi syndrome, there’s no reason why most people can’t lose weight. it may be true that certain genetic traits inherited from your parents\xa0–\xa0such as having a large appetite\xa0–\xa0may make losing weight more difficult, but it certainly doesn’t make it impossible. in many cases, obesity is more to do with environmental factors, such as poor eating habits learned during childhood.'}, {'medical reasons': ' in some cases, underlying medical conditions may contribute to weight gain. these include:an\xa0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\xa0–\xa0where your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones cushing’s syndrome\xa0–\xa0a rare disorder that causes the over-production of steroid hormones however, if conditions such as these are properly diagnosed and treated, they should pose less of a barrier to weight loss. certain medicines, including some\xa0corticosteroids, medications for epilepsy and diabetes, and some medications used to treat mental illness\xa0– including antidepressants and medicines for\xa0schizophrenia\xa0–\xa0can contribute to weight gain. weight gain can sometimes be a side effect of\xa0stopping smoking'}, {'diagnosing obesity': ' body mass index (bmi) is widely used as a simple and reliable way of finding out whether a person is a healthy weight for their height. for most adults, having a bmi of 18.5 to 24.9 means you’re considered to be a healthy weight. a person with a bmi of 25 to 29.9 is considered to be overweight, and someone with a bmi over 30 is considered to be obese. while bmi is a useful measurement for most people, it’s not accurate for everyone. for example, the normal bmi scores may not be accurate if you’re very muscular because muscle can add extra pounds, resulting in\xa0a high bmi when you’re not an unhealthy weight. in such cases, your waist circumference may be a better guide (see below). what’s considered a healthy bmi is also influenced by your ethnic background. the scores mentioned above generally apply to people with a white caucasian background. if you have an ethnic minority background, the threshold for being considered overweight or obese may be lower. bmi shouldn’t be used to work out whether a child is a healthy weight, because\xa0their bodies are still developing.\xa0speak to your gp if you want to find out whether your child is overweight.'}, {'visiting your gp': ' if you’re overweight or obese,\xa0visit your gp for advice about\xa0losing weight safely and to find out whether you have an increased risk of health problems. your gp\xa0may ask about:your lifestyle – particularly your diet and how much physical activity you do; they’ll also ask you whether you smoke and how much\xa0alcohol you drink any possible underlying causes for your obesity – for example, if you’re taking medication or have a medical condition that may contribute to\xa0weight gain how you feel about being overweight – for example, if it makes you feel depressed how motivated you are to lose weight your family history – as obesity and other health conditions, such as diabetes, are often more common in families as well as calculating your bmi, your gp may also carry out tests to determine whether you’re at increased risk of developing health complications because of your weight. these could include\xa0measuring your:blood pressure glucose (sugar) and cholesterol levels in a blood sample waist circumference (the distance around your waist) people with very large waists – generally, 94cm (37in) or more in men and 80cm (about 31.5in) or more in women – are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems. your gp may also take your ethnicity into account because it can affect your risk of developing certain conditions. for example, some people of asian, african or afro-caribbean ethnicity may be at increased risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). healthy waist measurements can also be different for people from different ethnic backgrounds. after your assessment, you’ll be offered an appointment to discuss the results in more detail, ask any questions that you have, and fully explore the treatment options available to you.'}, {'treating obesity': ' if you’re obese, speak to your gp for advice about losing weight safely. your gp can advise you about losing weight safely by eating a\xa0healthy, balanced diet and regular physical activity. they can also let you know about\xa0other useful services, such as:local weight loss groups – these could be provided by your local authority, the nhs, or commercial services you may have to pay for exercise on prescription – where you’re referred to a local active health team for a number of sessions under the supervision of a qualified trainer if you have underlying problems associated with obesity, such as polycystic

week, most people are advised to reduce their energy intake by 600 calories a day. for most men, this will mean consuming no more than 1,900 calories a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400 calories a day. the best way to achieve this\xa0is to swap unhealthy and high-energy food choices – such as fast food, processed food and sugary drinks (including alcohol) – for healthier choices. a healthy diet should consist of:plenty of fruit and vegetables plenty of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy foods (ideally you should choose wholegrain varieties) some\xa0milk and dairy foods some meat, fish, aggs,\xa0beans\xa0and other non-dairy sources of protein just small amounts of food and drinks that are high in\xa0fat\xa0and\xa0suagr try to avoid\xa0foods containing high levels of salt because they can raise your blood pressure, which can be dangerous\xa0for people who are already obese. you’ll also need to check\xa0calorie information for each type of food and drink you consume to make sure you don’t go over your daily limit. some restaurants,\xa0cafés and fast food outlets provide calorie information per portion, although providing this information isn’t compulsory. be careful\xa0when eating out because some foods can quickly take you over the limit, such as burgers, fried chicken, and some curries or chinese dishes.'}, {'exercise': ' reducing the amount of calories in your diet will help you lose weight, but maintaining a healthy weight requires physical activity to burn energy. as well as helping you maintain a healthy weight, physical activity also has wider health benefits. for example, it can help prevent and manage more than\xa020 conditions, such as reducing the risk of\xa0type 2 diabetes by 40%. the chief medical officers recommend that adults should do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of at least moderate-intensity activity a week – for example, five 30-minute bouts a week. something is better than nothing, and doing just 10 minutes of exercise at a time is beneficial. moderate-intensity activity is any activity that increases your heart and breathing rate, such as:brisk walking cycling recreational swimming dancing alternatively, you could do 75 minutes (one hour, fifteen minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity\xa0a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. during vigorous activity, breathing is very hard, your heart beats rapidly and you may be unable to hold a conversation. examples include:running most competitive sports circuit training you should also do strength and balance training two days a week. this could be in the form of a\xa0gym workout, carrying shopping bags, or doing an activity such as\xa0tai chi.\xa0it’s also critical that you break up sitting

behavioural therapy (cbt)\xa0can be useful.'}, {'medication': ' many\xa0different types of anti-obesity medicines have been tested in clinical trials, but only one has proved to be safe and effective: orlistat. you can only use orlistat if a doctor or pharmacist thinks it’s the right medicine for you. in most cases, orlistat is only available on prescription. only one product (alli) is available over the counter directly from pharmacies, under the supervision of a pharmacist. orlistat works by preventing\xa0around a third of the fat from the food you eat being absorbed. the undigested fat isn’t absorbed into your body and is passed out with your faeces (stools). this will help you avoid gaining weight, but won’t necessarily cause you to lose weight. a balanced diet and exercise

cancer treating ovarian cancer for more information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general\xa0ovarian cancer\xa0section. ovarian cancer starts in the ovaries, which are part of the reproductive system. this is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby.'}, {'your reproductive system': ' your reproductive system is made up of the:vagina\xa0– the passage from the cervix to outside your body cervix\xa0– the opening from the womb to the vagina womb (also called uterus)\xa0– where a baby grows during pregnancy fallopian tubes\xa0– which connect your ovaries to the womb ovaries\xa0– which store all your eggs and release one every month after puberty'}, {'facts about ovaries': ' you have\xa02 ovaries\xa0– 1 on each side of your womb. they’re about 4cm long. at puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. these cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start. every month after puberty, your ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes to the womb. the womb’s lining gets thicker, ready for an egg to be fertilised by a man’s sperm. if this doesn’t happen, the womb’s lining comes out of your vagina as blood. this is a period. when a woman is about 50 her periods stop because her ovaries have run out of eggs so they stop making hormones. this is called the menopause.'}, {'types of ovarian cancer': ' there are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours. teenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. you may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called:dysgerminoma teratoma yolk sac tumour germ cell tumours of the ovary are rare. they start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary. treatment will usually cure germ cell tumours. your specialist will explain more about the type of germ cell tumour that you have. if you have a type of ovarian cancer or germ cell tumour that’s not listed here, you can talk to one of\xa0macmillan’s\xa0cancer support

teenagers and young women. if you have a different type of ovarian cancer and want to know more you can\xa0talk to macmillan cancer support. germ cell tumours are a rare type of ovarian cancer. they start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary in girls and young women (aged 10 to 30). tumours are often only in\xa01 ovary. they can usually be successfully treated, even if they’ve spread to other places in the body. germ cell tumours can also develop in teenage boys’ or men’s testicles, or rarely in other parts of the body. this page is about germ cell tumours that start in the ovary, but we have more information about\xa0testicular cancer.'}, {'causes': ' the cause of germ cell tumours is unknown. research into possible causes is going on all the time. germ cells are a normal part of the ovary, but something causes them to change. this makes them grow too quickly and make a tumour.'}, {'signs and symptoms': 'pain or swelling in your tummy (abdomen) a\xa0feeling of fullness or bloating in your tummy needing to pee more often irregular periods remember – these symptoms happen for lots of reasons other than cancer. but if you have any of them it’s important to speak to your gp.'},

to talk to you about your symptoms. if they think these could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more.'}, {'at the hospital': ' the specialist will carry out an internal examination to check if there’s anything unusual in the shape and position of your ovaries and womb. your gp may have already done an internal examination.'}, {'treatment for germ cell tumours of the ovary': ' most girls and young women can be cured of germ cell tumours of the ovary. your treatment will depend on the type of germ cell tumour you have and whether it has spread outside the ovaries. treatment is usually a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, although you may only need surgery. before you have treatment, your specialist needs to know the type of germ cell tumour you have and what stage it is. the stage of a cancer describes the size of the tumour and whether it has spread outside the ovary to any other parts of your body. your specialist will tell you the exact stage of the cancer after the operation to remove your ovary. most germ cell tumours are diagnosed early when they’re in one or sometimes both ovaries but haven’t spread anywhere else in the body. waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. but this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment. another important part of ovarian cancer treatment is to try to make sure it doesn’t make you infertile (unable to get pregnant). your doctors will think very carefully about this when planning your treatment.'}, {'surgery': ' you may have an\xa0operation\xa0to remove the affected ovary and the fallopian tube. if it’s a very early germ cell tumour this might be the only treatment you need. after your operation you’ll come back to the clinic for regular checks. if there are any signs of the cancer coming back, it’s treated straight away. having the affected ovary and fallopian tube removed won’t stop you from having a baby in the future. you can still get pregnant with only\xa01 ovary. before surgery you’ll have a general anaesthetic. during the operation, the surgeon will make a cut in the lower tummy. the ovary is removed through this cut. the operation is called a laparotomy. if the cancer has spread, the surgeon may still do an operation to try to remove as much of the tumour as they can. if possible they will try to leave the other ovary and the womb. you will have more treatment after your operation to treat any of the tumour that they could not remove. removing both ovaries and the womb is only done if there’s no other way of successfully treating the cancer. unfortunately this means you will not be able to get pregnant in the future. this can be very upsetting news. you may not have thought about having children yet, so it may be difficult to take in. if this happens there will be lots of support to help you.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy\xa0is given after your operation to:get rid of any cancer cells that weren’t removed with surgery stop the cancer from coming back your specialist will explain more about this to you. germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy and this treatment cures most girls. if it’s a very early germ cell tumour you might not even need chemotherapy. germ cell tumours are often treated with the drugs bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin. when these are given together it’s called bep for short. chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment that usually take 3 weeks. you’ll have 3 to 4 cycles. you’ll spend the first 3 to 5 days of each cycle having your chemotherapy. you’ll usually stay in hospital for those days. you’ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and then again the following week. different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. some girls just have a few side effects, and others have more. most side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops. the most common side effects are:hair loss tiredness feeling sick or being sick (this can often be controlled with medicine) being more at risk of getting an infection doctors can’t be certain whether you’ll be able to get pregnant (fertility) in the future after you’ve had chemotherapy. they may talk to you about storing your eggs before chemotherapy starts. stored eggs can be used with fertility treatments when you’re ready to try to get pregnant. read more in\xa0macmillan’s section on\xa0fertility in young women.'}, {'surgery and chemotherapy': ' you’ll usually have chemotherapy after your surgery. you might have

overactive thyroid,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/glands/overactive-thyroid/,"[{'about overactive thyroids': ' overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body. excess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body’s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as:nervousness and anxiety hyperactivity – where a person can’t stay still and is full of nervous energy unexplained or unplanned weight loss swelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goitre, to form in the throat the severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person. read more about the symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland'}, {'what causes an overactive thyroid gland?': ' the thyroid gland is found in the neck. it produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body’s growth and metabolism. these hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine. they affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going. in hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body’s metabolism. there are several possible underlying causes, the most common being graves’ disease, in which the body’s immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones. read more about the causes of an overactive thyroid gland'}, {'treatment': ' an overactive thyroid\xa0usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms. the 3 most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are:thionamides – a group of medications, including\xa0carbimazole and methimazole,\xa0that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone radioiodine treatment –\xa0a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland, reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health) surgery –\xa0in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the\xa0thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitre beta-blockers may also\xa0sometimes be used\xa0to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland, although it doesn’t target the thyroid gland itself. it’s common for treatment to lead to the thyroid not producing enough hormones. this is known as having an\xa0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\xa0however, an\xa0underactive thyroid is not\xa0usually serious and\xa0is easily treated. read more about the treatment of an overactive thyroid gland'}, {'complications': ' around 1 in 20 people with graves’ disease will also develop symptoms affecting their eyes, such as:double vision sensitivity to light (photophobia) tearing (excess production of tears) this is known as graves’ ophthalmopathy and should be seen by a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (an ophthalmologist). a rarer and more serious complication is a\xa0sudden and severe flare-up of

overactive thyroid': ' an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) has many signs and symptoms, although it is unlikely you would develop all of them.'}, {'symptoms of hyperthyroidism': ' if you have hyperthyroidism, you may experience some of the following symptoms:hyperactivity mood swings – such as anxiety, irritability and nervousness difficulty sleeping (insomnia) feeling tired all the time

an overactive thyroid gland, but they will need further investigation. it might be useful to make a list of your symptoms, as this can often be helpful in determining the correct diagnosis.'}, {'causes of an overactive thyroid': ' overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones thyroxine or triiodothyronine. overproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions.'}, {'graves’ disease': ' graves’ disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. it can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years old. you are more likely to develop graves’ disease if you smoke. graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition.\xa0this means the immune system mistakes\xa0something\xa0in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it. in\xa0graves’ disease,\xa0it attacks the\xa0thyroid gland, which\xa0leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones. it is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved. if you have graves’ disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. this is known as graves’ ophthalmopathy. you may find\xa0your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent. for more information on graves’ ophthalmopathy, read\xa0complications of an overactive thyroid gland.'}, {'thyroid nodules': ' it is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. these are known as nodules. it is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign). however, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic. toxic thyroid nodules account for about\xa01 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism.'}, {'iodine supplements': ' iodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. however, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine. this is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism – sometimes referred to as jod-basedow phenomenon. it usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland.'}, {'amiodarone': ' amiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation). if you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine. amiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. this type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.'}, {'follicular thyroid cancer': ' in rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result of\xa0thyroid cancer that starts in your thyroid follicles. this can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. this is also known as functioning thyroid cancer.'}, {'diagnosing an overactive thyroid': ' see your gp if you think you may have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). a diagnosis will be based on your symptoms and the results of\xa0blood tests that assess how well your thyroid gland is working. these are known as thyroid function tests.'}, {'thyroid function tests': ' your gp will take a sample of your blood and test it for levels of:thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) thyroxine and triiodothyronine (the thyroid hormones) tsh is made in the pituitary gland in your brain and controls the production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. when the level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in your blood are normal, your pituitary gland releases a normal level of tsh. when thyroid hormone production becomes excessive, the pituitary gland stops releasing tsh. when the level of thyroxine or triiodothyronine drops, the pituitary gland produces more tsh to boost it. if you have an overactive thyroid, the thyroid function test will show that levels of tsh in your blood are consistently lower than normal. low levels of tsh mean your thyroid gland is overactive and\xa0likely to be making\xa0excessive thyroid hormones. this is the first part of the thyroid function test. your gp will then test your blood for levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. if you have an overactive thyroid, you will have higher than normal levels of both these hormones.'}, {'determining the underlying cause': ' if tests confirm an overactive thyroid gland, you may be referred for further tests to determine the underlying cause. an additional test that may be used is an isotope thyroid scan. this involves swallowing small amounts of a radioactive substance (an isotope), usually technetium, in capsule or liquid form. a scan is then used to measure how much of the isotope has been absorbed by your thyroid gland. if your thyroid gland absorbs a high amount of the isotope, it is likely\xa0the underlying cause is either graves’ disease or thyroid nodules. if the amount is low, the underlying cause could be due to:swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), often caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking thyroid tissue or, less commonly, by infection having too much iodine in your diet in rare cases,\xa0thyroid cancer'}, {'treating an overactive thyroid': ' if you are diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), your gp will refer you to a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to plan your treatment.'}, {'thionamides': ' thionamides, such as carbimazole and propylthiouracil, are a common treatment. they are a type of medication that stops your thyroid gland producing excess amounts of thyroxine or triiodothyronine. as thionamides affect the production of thyroid hormone rather than their current levels, you will need to take them for several weeks before you notice an improvement (usually between 4 to 8 weeks). once the production of thyroid hormones is under control, your specialist may gradually reduce your medication. you may need to continue taking thionamides for a long time, until the condition is under control. around 1 in 20 people will experience side effects when they first start taking thionamides, such as:itchy skin rash joint pain these side effects should pass once your body is used to the effects of the medication. in rare cases (around 1 in 500), thionamides cause a sudden drop in white blood cells (agranulocytosis), which can make you extremely vulnerable to infection. symptoms of agranulocytosis include:fever gum pain, swelling and bleeding sore throat mouth ulcers persistent\xa0cough shortness of breath if you are taking thionamides and you experience any of the symptoms above, phone your gp immediately for advice and an urgent blood test. if this is not possible, phone 111\xa0or your local out-of-hours service.'}, {'beta-blockers': ' beta-blockers,\xa0such as propranolol or atenolol, can relieve some of the symptoms of an overactive thyroid, including tremor (shaking and trembling), rapid heartbeat and hyperactivity. your specialist may prescribe you a beta-blocker while the condition is being diagnosed, or until\xa0thionamide brings your thyroid gland under control. however, beta-blockers are not suitable if you have asthma. beta-blockers can sometimes cause side effects, including:feeling sick feeling tired all the time (fatigue) cold hands and feet trouble sleeping, sometimes with nightmares'}, {'radioiodine treatment': ' radioiodine treatment is a form of radiotherapy used to treat most types of overactive thyroid. radioactive iodine shrinks your thyroid gland, reducing the amount of thyroid hormone it can produce. radioiodine treatment\xa0is\xa0given either as a drink or a capsule to swallow. the dose of radioactivity in the radioiodine is very low and is not harmful. radioiodine treatment is not suitable if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, and may not be suitable if you have eye problems, such as double vision or prominent (bulging) eyes. women should avoid getting pregnant for at least 6 months after having radioiodine treatment. men should not father a child for at least 4 months after having radioiodine treatment. most people only require a single dose of radioiodine treatment. if a further follow-up dose is required, it is usually given 6 to 12 months after the first dosage. a short course of thionamides treatment may be given a few weeks before radioiodine treatment, as this can lead to a more rapid relief of symptoms.'}, {'thionamides or radioiodine?': ' in some cases, a particular treatment may be recommended based on factors such as your age, symptoms and the amount of extra thyroid hormone in your blood. however, there may be circumstances when you are offered a choice between a long-term course of thionamides or radioiodine treatment. both treatments have advantages and disadvantages. advantages of thionamides include:they are straightforward to take and you do not have to go to hospital to take them there is less risk of getting an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) as a result of treatment disadvantages of thionamides include:treatment\xa0may not be as successful as radioiodine treatment there is a higher risk of side effects advantages of radioiodine treatment include:treatment is usually very successful disadvantages of radioiodine treatment include:there is\xa0a higher chance of your thyroid gland becoming underactive as a result of treatment radioiodine treatment is usually not suitable for people with additional symptoms affecting their eyes (graves’ ophthalmopathy) women have to avoid getting pregnant for at least 6 months, and men should not father a child for at least 4 months after treatment you should discuss the potential risks and benefits of both types of treatment with the specialist in charge of your care.'}, {'surgery': ' surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland is known as a total or partial thyroidectomy. it is a permanent cure for recurrent overactive thyroid. your specialist may recommend surgery if your thyroid gland is severely swollen (a large goitre) and is causing problems in your neck. other reasons for surgery include:a person cannot be treated with radioiodine treatment as they are pregnant and are unable or unwilling to take\xa0thionamides a person has a severe form of graves’ ophthalmopathy the symptoms return (relapse) after a previous successful course of treatment with thionamides it is normally recommended that the entire thyroid gland is removed, as this means\xa0there will be no chance of a relapse. however, you will need to take medication for the rest of your life to compensate for the lack of a functioning thyroid gland – these will be the same medications used to treat an underactive thyroid gland.'},

disease of the nipple, also known as paget’s disease of the breast, is a rare type of breast cancer. the term paget’s disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from\xa0paget’s disease of the bone, which\xa0occurs when the normal cycle of bone growth is disrupted, leading to the bones becoming weak and deformed. a similar type of\xa0skin cancer can also occur in other parts of the body. the rest of this section will use the term paget’s disease to refer to paget’s disease of the nipple or breast.'}, {'symptoms of paget’s disease': ' paget’s disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and\xa0produces eczema-like symptoms, appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola). it can also appear as a small ulcer or dry, red, flaky patches of skin similar to psoriasis. other possible symptoms include:itchiness or a burning sensation – alongside visible changes to the nipple bleeding from the skin of the nipple if you’re experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and isn’t red, dry or scaly – this is extremely unlikely to be paget’s disease but should still be checked by a doctor.'}, {'causes of paget’s disease': ' paget’s disease is usually a sign of\xa0breast cancer in tissue behind the nipple, or breast tissue away from the nipple. the breast cancer can either be:invasive –\xa0where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue non-invasive\xa0– where the cancerous cells are contained in one or more areas of the breast and are unable to spread in a small amount of cases, the only evidence of paget’s disease is the nipple changes. in about half of all cases of paget’s disease of the nipple, a lump is found in the breast. the majority of people with a lump will have invasive breast cancer, although this does not necessarily mean it has spread. most people with paget’s disease of the nipple who don’t have a lump will have non-invasive breast cancer.'}, {'diagnosing paget’s disease': ' you should visit your gp if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple). as paget’s disease is a form of breast cancer, the sooner it’s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be. speak to your gp if you develop a lump in your breast. while most\xa0breast lumps are not cancerous, it’s important\xa0you have it checked out. read more about:the symptoms of breast cancer how paget’s disease is diagnosed'}, {'treating paget’s disease': ' paget’s disease is treated in the same way as breast cancer. surgery is\xa0usually the first line of treatment but unlike other forms of breast cancer, it involves removing breast tissue that includes the nipple and areola. this may be followed by a combination of:chemotherapy\xa0– where powerful medication is used to destroy cancerous cells radiotherapy\xa0– where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells

lump may slightly increase your risk but this is only seen in a small number of women being overweight – which is especially significant in post-menopausal women alcohol – your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink'}, {'diagnosing paget’s disease of the nipple': ' as paget’s disease of the nipple is usually a sign of breast cancer, it’s very

darker area of skin around the\xa0nipple) your breasts, particularly\xa0lumps in your breast paget’s disease of the nipple can sometimes be confused with\xa0eczema, a skin condition that also\xa0causes red, itchy and dry skin. therefore, you should visit your gp for a diagnosis rather\xa0than assuming you have eczema. paget’s disease is a form\xa0of\xa0breast cancer and\xa0the sooner it’s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be. your gp will examine both breasts, even if you only have a problem with\xa0one of them. they may also ask you:about your symptoms and how long you have had them whether you have a history of eczema, or have eczema anywhere else on your body whether you have a personal or family history of breast cancer your age and whether you have experienced the menopause (when a woman’s monthly periods stop) whether you’re taking any medication, including hormone replacement therapy (hrt), which is used to treat some of the symptoms of the menopause, or the oral contraceptive pill how much\xa0alcohol you drink how much you weigh and if you have recently gained weight if your gp thinks you may have breast cancer, they will refer you to a specialist breast clinic for tests.'}, {'breast clinic': ' when you visit a breast clinic you will have tests to find out whether you have breast cancer and, if you have,\xa0what type of breast cancer. staff at the clinic may take photographs of your breasts to record their current appearance and to help identify any further changes that may occur. tests carried out at the clinic may include the following:an examination of your breast to check for lumps or other abnormalities a\xa0mammogram (if you are\xa035 years of age or over) an\xa0ultrasound scan – which is the first line of investigation used in younger women a skin biopsy will be carried out if paget’s disease is suspected'}, {'further tests': ' there are a number of other tests that can be used if a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed and help determine what types of treatment might be used.'}, {'treating paget’s disease of the nipple': ' paget’s disease of the nipple is often associated with other forms of breast cancer. it’s usually\xa0treated in the same way as more common types of breast cancer, either by removing the cancerous section of the breast or sometimes by removing the entire breast – a procedure known as a mastectomy. you can discuss any concerns you have with your oncologist (cancer specialist) who will be able to explain each phase of your treatment.'}, {'surgery': ' if you’re diagnosed with paget’s disease, surgery is often the first form of treatment you will receive. there are 2 main types of surgery. they are:mastectomy – surgery to remove the whole breast, which can be followed by reconstructive surgery to recreate the removed breast breast-conserving surgery – surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour) in your breast these types of surgery will also involve removing your nipple and the darker area of skin surrounding it (the areola).'}, {'breast reconstruction': ' if you have a mastectomy, you may be able to have reconstructive surgery to recreate your breast. this can be done by:inserting a breast implant using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast the reconstruction can be carried out at the time of your mastectomy or at a later stage. you should discuss your options fully with your surgeon and breast nurse before making a decision. for example, it may be possible to have reconstructive surgery after breast-conserving surgery to improve the appearance of your breast and create a nipple.'}, {'prostheses': ' if you decide not to have breast reconstruction, you can wear a false breast or breast prosthesis, which are available free on the nhs. after having a mastectomy, you may have a temporary, fibre-filled prosthesis and a permanent prosthesis made from silicone, which can be replaced every 2 years.'}, {'further treatment': ' after your surgery, you may need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer, where the cancerous cells have spread into other tissue in your breast. if you had non-invasive breast cancer, where the breast cancer cells were contained in one area of your breast, surgery may be all the treatment you need. other types of treatment for breast cancer include:chemotherapy – cytotoxic medication that prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing is used to destroy cancer cells radiotherapy\xa0– where controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usually x-rays, are used to destroy cancer cells biological therapy – if your breast cancer is her2 positive, biological therapy, usually a medication called trastuzumab, can be used to treat the cancer by stopping the effects of her2 and helping your immune system fight off cancer cells hormone therapy – if your breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive, hormone therapy can be used to treat the cancer by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or stopping their effects'}, {'preventing paget’s disease of the nipple': ' a number of factors can help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer, including paget’s

there are benefits for women who maintain a\xa0healthy weight, do regular exercise and who have a low intake of\xa0saturated fat and alcohol. it has been suggested that exercising regularly (a minimum of 150 minutes or 2 hours 30 minutes a week)\xa0can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by\xa0up to\xa0a third. if you have been through the\xa0menopause (when your monthly periods stop), it’s particularly important you are not overweight or obese. this is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.'}, {'breastfeeding': ' studies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don’t. the reasons are not fully understood, but it could be because women don’t ovulate as regularly while they are breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.'}, {'medication': ' in june 2013, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) announced that two medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the nhs for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. either tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who have been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven’t. these medications may not be suitable if in the past you have had blood clots\xa0or womb cancer, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future. women who have already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won’t be offered these medications because their risk of developing breast cancer is so small. a course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years. raloxifene can cause side effects including flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods and nausea and vomiting. your chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increases while you’re taking tamoxifen, so you’ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. the medication can also increase your risk of blood clots so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before any planned surgery. currently, these 2 medications are not licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased risk of developing the condition. however, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.'}, {'breast screening': ' breast screening can pick up breast cancer before it forms a lump. the procedure uses mammograms, where x-rays\xa0are taken,\xa0to create an image of the inside of your breasts. the\xa0nhs breast screening programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the uk who are 50 years of age or over. the nhs has recently extended the breast screening age range so that all women who are 47\xa0to 73 years of age will be eligible for breast screening. nhs breast screening is not usually available for women under 47 years of age. this is because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue which makes

lie down or after you’ve eaten. you may also have pain or tenderness in your abdomen if your liver, pancreas or gallbladder are enlarged.'}, {'weight loss': ' many types of cancer cause weight loss, because the cancerous cells deprive your healthy cells of the nutrients they need. pancreatic cancer is more likely to cause weight loss than some other cancers because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which help food to be absorbed into your body. if a tumour disrupts that production, your body will find it harder to digest food, particularly high-fat foods. this can cause you to lose weight and become\xa0malnourished.'}, {'jaundice': ' jaundice is caused by a build-up of a yellowish-brown substance called bilirubin in the blood and tissues of the body. the most obvious sign of

{'magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan': ' a\xa0magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan\xa0also produces an image of the inside of your body, but it uses strong magnetic and radio waves instead of x-rays. mri scans are carried out in a tube-shaped\xa0mri scanner. it’s a noisy procedure that\xa0can feel claustrophobic. it also takes longer than other types of\xa0scans. like a ct scan, an mri scan allows your doctor to check for signs of\xa0cancer\xa0in other parts of the body.'}, {'positron emission tomography (pet) scan': ' a positron emission tomography (pet) scan can help to show where the cancer is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. before the scan, you’ll be given an injection of a very small amount of a radioactive medication, known as\xa0a tracer. the amount of\xa0radiation is very small and no more than you would receive from a normal x-ray. the most common tracer used is a radioactive form of glucose (sugar).\xa0you’ll then rest for about an hour to allow the tracer to travel to areas in your body where glucose is used for energy. the scan itself can take up to an hour and produces an image of the tracer in your body. the tracer shows up cancers because they use glucose in a different way to normal tissue.'}, {'endoluminal ultrasonography (eus)': ' if a small shadow is seen on a ct or mri scan but it’s not obvious what it\xa0is, another test called endoluminal ultrasonography (eus) can be carried out. during eus, a thin, flexible\xa0instrument called\xa0an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. an ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope will then be used to take close-up pictures of your pancreas. before the procedure, you may be given a sedative to help you relax. eus can also be used to take a\xa0biopsy\xa0for further examination.'}, {'endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp)': ' endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) is a procedure used to insert a plastic tube or stent into the bile duct if\xa0someone has\xa0jaundice. during ercp, an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. the endoscope can then be used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts. after the dye has been injected, an x-ray will be taken. the dye will show up on the x-ray and will highlight any tumour that’s blocking the bile and pancreatic ducts. during the procedure, tissue samples may be taken. these samples can be looked at under a microscope to see whether the cells are cancerous. ercp can take 30 to 60 minutes. as with eus, you’ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax.'}, {'laparoscopy': ' a\xa0laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen and pelvis. during the procedure, a small\xa0incision will be made in your abdomen, and a laparoscope (a thin,\xa0flexible microscope) will be inserted. this will allow the surgeon to see inside your body and make sure the tumour hasn’t spread before recommending its removal. this procedure will be carried out\xa0under a\xa0general anaesthetic\xa0(where you’re put to sleep so you don’t feel any pain or discomfort).'}, {'biopsy': ' a\xa0biopsy\xa0involves taking a sample from a suspected tumour, which\xa0can then be tested to see if it’s cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). a biopsy can be carried out during an eus, ercp or laparoscopy using\xa0a small instrument attached to the endoscope to collect a number of cells. it’s also possible for a\xa0biopsy to be carried out using a long, thin needle that’s passed through your abdomen. the needle will be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound or ct scan.'}, {'recovering from pancreatic cancer': ' recovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process. you’ll probably experience some pain after your operation. the staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief. after any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. this means you won’t be able to eat or drink straight away. you’ll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. you may\xa0be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation. after the tumour has been removed, you will probably have a 6-month course of\xa0chemotherapy, which greatly increases your chance of being cured. however, as cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don’t recover\xa0completely. treatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth.'}, {'help

with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time.'}, {'anxiety': ' anxiety is a feeling of unease. it can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. there are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety includingphobias\xa0– an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal generalised anxiety disorder (gad) – a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations post-traumatic stress disorder – a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening events'}, {'panic attacks': ' a panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. you may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. as well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as:nausea sweating trembling a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations) the number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week. read more about the symptoms of panic disorder. panic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they’re not dangerous. an attack won’t cause you any physical harm, and it’s unlikely that you’ll be admitted to hospital if you’ve had a panic attack.'}, {'what causes panic disorder?': ' as with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn’t fully understood. however, it’s thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors. read about the possible causes of panic disorder. it’s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety. for example:mitral valve prolapse postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (pots) anaemia paroxysmal atrial tachycardia – episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly thyrotoxicosis – where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat, sweating, tremor and anxiety poorly controlled diabetes adrenal tumours – growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys) carcinoid syndrome – a set of symptoms caused by some carcinoid tumours that can develop in the cells of the endocrine system (glands that produce and secrete hormones) zollinger-ellison syndrome – causes overproduction of insulin and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)'}, {'diagnosing panic disorder': ' see your gp if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above). you may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks. read more about how panic disorder is diagnosed.'}, {'treating panic disorder': ' the aim of treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease the severity of your symptoms. psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder. read more about treating panic disorder and things you can do to help yourself during a panic attack. having panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. it’s your legal obligation to inform the driver and vehicle licensing agency (dvla) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability. gov.uk has further information and advice about driving with a disability or health condition.'}, {'complications of panic disorder': ' panic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it’s important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it’s given at an early stage. left untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. it can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other phobias. agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong. read more about the complications of panic disorder.'}, {'symptoms': ' the symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing. symptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason. as well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other\xa0symptoms, including:a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations) sweating trembling hot flushes chills shortness of breath a choking sensation chest pain nausea dizziness feeling\xa0faint numbness or\xa0pins and needles dry mouth a need to go to the toilet ringing in your ears a feeling of dread or a fear of dying a churning stomach a tingling sensation in your fingers shivering shaking the physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror. for this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which\xa0creates a\xa0cycle of living in ‘fear of fear’ and adds to the sense of panic. sometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you’re having a heart attack. however, it’s important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won’t result in you having a heart attack. although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don’t cause any physical harm. people who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this ‘heart attack sensation’ and\xa0become more aware of how to control their symptoms. most panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes.\xa0some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. however, it’s likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack.'}, {'recurrent panic attacks': ' people with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week. people with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. the panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable. if you have panic disorder, you may also\xa0feel\xa0anxious about when your next attack will be.'}, {'depersonalisation': ' during a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can\xa0feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. it can almost feel as if you’re an observer, making the situation seem very unreal. this sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. being detached from the situation doesn’t provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating.'}, {'causes': ' as with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn’t fully understood. it’s thought that panic disorder is probably caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. some of these factors are outlined below.'}, {'traumatic life experiences': ' a trauma, such as bereavement, can sometimes trigger feelings of panic and anxiety. these feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later.'}, {'genetics': ' having a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person’s risk of developing it. however, the precise nature of the risk isn’t known.'}, {'neurotransmitters': ' neurotransmitters are chemicals that occur naturally in the brain. it’s thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder.'}, {'increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide': ' some experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks.'}, {'catastrophic thinking': ' another theory is that people who experience panic attacks tend to focus on\xa0minor physical symptoms and interpret them in a catastrophic way. this triggers a nervous system response that causes the panic attack.'}, {'diagnosis': ' everyone who has panic disorder will experience panic attacks. however, not everyone who has\xa0panic attacks is diagnosed with panic disorder.'}, {'panic attacks': ' some people have panic attacks in response to specific situations. for example, they may have a phobia (overwhelming fear) of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) and have a panic attack when faced with an enclosed space. while most people with\xa0phobias only experience panic attacks when faced with the thing that\xa0triggers their fear, the panic attacks of people with panic disorder usually occur without warning and for no obvious reason. this means that panic disorder will only be diagnosed after experiencing recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, and if the attacks are followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.'}, {'talk to your gp': ' your gp will ask you to describe the symptoms you’ve been experiencing. they’ll also ask you how often your symptoms occur and in what situations. it’s important to tell your gp about how you’ve been feeling and how your symptoms have affected you. although it can sometimes be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life,\xa0try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. your gp needs to gain a good understanding of your symptoms to\xa0make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment for you.'}, {'physical examination': ' your gp may also want to carry out a physical examination to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. for example, an\xa0overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause similar symptoms to a panic attack. by ruling out any underlying medical conditions, your gp will be able to make the correct diagnosis.'}, {'treatment': ' the main aim in treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks and ease the severity of symptoms. psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder. depending on your individual circumstances, you may need one of these treatment types or a combination of the two. if you’re offered psychological therapy, it will probably be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt). if this doesn’t work, medication may be recommended. before starting any form of treatment, your gp will discuss all of the options with you, outlining the advantages of each type and making you aware of any possible risks or side effects. no single treatment works for everyone and you may need to try a number of treatments before finding one that works for you. the treatment that’s recommended will depend on your general level of health, the severity of your condition and your personal preferences. it’s important you understand what your treatment will involve. if you don’t understand something your gp has told you, ask them to explain it in more detail.'}, {'cognitive behavioural therapy': ' psychological therapy has proven long-term benefits and it’s recommended for treating panic disorder. it will usually take the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt). cbt is thought to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for panic disorder. it involves having regular sessions with a therapist. the therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about when you’re experiencing an attack. once you and your therapist have identified any negative thoughts and beliefs, you can work on replacing them with more realistic and balanced ones. your therapist can also teach you ways of changing your behaviour, making it easier for you to deal with future panic attacks. for example, they may be able to show you breathing techniques that can be used to help keep you calm during a panic attack. the\xa0national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends a total of seven to 14 hours of cbt to be completed within a four month period. treatment will usually involve having a weekly one to two hour session. nice also recommends that in certain situations a shorter programme of cbt may be appropriate. this can involve a reduced number of hours of cbt with ‘homework’ being set between sessions so that you can practice what you’ve learnt after each session. you should visit your gp regularly\xa0while you’re having cbt so that they can assess your progress and see how you’re doing.'}, {'support groups': ' support groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. they’re also a good way of meeting other people who’ve had similar experiences of the condition. panic attacks can sometimes be frightening and isolating, so it can be helpful to know that other people are experiencing the same feelings and emotions as you. anxiety uk and triumph over phobia (top uk) are uk-based charities that provide information and support for people with anxiety disorders. support groups often involve face-to-face meetings where you can talk about your problems and difficulties with others. many can also provide support and guidance over the telephone or in writing. ask your gp about support groups for panic disorder near you. you can also use the services directory to\xa0find anxiety services in your area.'}, {'antidepressants': ' antidepressants\xa0are often associated with depression, but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions. antidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective. it’s therefore important to continue taking them, even if you feel they’re\xa0not working. you should only ever stop taking prescribed medication if your gp specifically advises you to do so. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and tricyclic antidepressants are two types of antidepressants that are often recommended for treating\xa0panic disorder. when starting a new type of medication, you should be regularly assessed by your gp at two, four, six and 12 week intervals. this will allow you to discuss any issues that you have with your medication, and enables your gp to assess which treatment is most effective. it will also provide you with the opportunity to try a different type of medication if you want to.'}, {'pregabalin': ' pregabalin is another medication that’s often used to treat panic disorder. it’s an anticonvulsant that’s also used to treat\xa0epilepsy (a condition that causes repeated seizures). however, it’s also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety. side effects of pregabalin can include:drowsiness dizziness increased appetite and weight gain blurred vision headaches dry mouth vertigo – the sensation that you, or the environment around you, are moving or spinning pregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than ssris.'}, {'clonazepam': ' clonazepam is another medication that’s often used to treat epilepsy and is also sometimes prescribed for panic disorder. it can cause a wide variety of side effects including lethargy (lack of energy), abnormal eye movement (nystagmus), confusion and allergic reactions.'}, {'referral': ' you may be referred to a mental health specialist if treatments such as attending a support group, cbt and medication don’t improve your symptoms of panic disorder. a mental health specialist will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. they’ll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it. they may also ask you about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends. the specialist will be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to effectively treat your symptoms. the type of mental health specialist that you’ll be referred to will depend on your individual situation. for example, you may be referred to a:psychiatrist – a trained medical doctor who specialises in mental health; a psychiatrist is one of the only mental health specialists who is able to prescribe medication clinical psychologist – who is trained in the scientific study of human behaviour and mental processes and focuses solely on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; a clinical psychologist will help you to find ways of effectively managing your anxiety and panic attacks'}, {'things you can do to help yourself': ' there are several self-help techniques you can use to help treat the symptoms of panic disorder yourself. some of these techniques are listed below.'}, {'stay where you are': ' if possible, you should stay where you are during a panic attack. the attack could last up to an hour, so you may need to pull over and park where it’s safe to do so if you’re driving.'}, {'focus': ' if you have a panic attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations will eventually pass. during an attack, try to focus on something that’s non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket.'}, {'slow deep breathing': ' while you’re having a panic attack, try to focus on your breathing. feelings of panic and\xa0anxiety can get worse if you breathe too quickly. try breathing slowly and deeply while counting to three on each breath in and out.'}, {'challenge your fear': ' when you have a panic attack, try to identify what it is you fear and challenge it. you can achieve this by constantly reminding yourself that what you fear isn’t real and that it will pass in a few minutes.'}, {'creative visualisation': ' many things can go through your mind during a panic attack – for example, some people think about disaster or death. instead of focusing on negative thoughts, try to concentrate on positive images. think of a place or a situation that makes you feel peaceful, relaxed or at ease. once you have this image in your mind, try to focus your attention on it. it should help distract you from the situation and may also help ease your symptoms. thinking positively can be difficult, particularly if you’ve got used to thinking negatively over a long period of time. creative visualisation is a technique that requires practice, but you may gradually notice positive changes in the way you think about yourself and others.'}, {'don’t fight a panic attack': ' fighting a panic attack can often make it worse. trying to resist the attack and finding you’re unable to can increase your sense of anxiety and panic. instead, during a panic attack, reassure yourself by accepting that although it may seem embarrassing, and your symptoms may be difficult to deal with, the attack isn’t life-threatening. focus on the fact that the attack will evetually end and try your best to let it pass.'}, {'relaxation': ' if you have panic disorder, you may feel constantly stressed and anxious, particularly about when your next panic attack may be. learning to relax can help to relieve some of this tension, and it may also help you to deal more effectively with your panic attacks when they occur. some people find complementary therapies, such as massage and aromatherapy, help them to relax. activities, such as yoga and pilates, can also be helpful. you can also practise breathing and relaxation techniques, which you can use during a panic attack to help ease your symptoms.'}, {'exercise': ' regular exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, will help reduce stress and release tension. it can also encourage your brain to release the chemical serotonin, which can help improve your mood. it’s\xa0recommended that adults aged 19-64 years should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast\xa0walking, every week. they should also do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). visit your gp for a fitness assessment before starting a new exercise programme if you haven’t exercised before or for a long time. read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults.'}, {'diet': ' unstable blood sugar levels can contribute to the symptoms of a panic attack. therefore, you should maintain a healthy, balanced diet, eat regularly and avoid eating sugary food and drinks. also, avoid caffeine, alcohol and smoking because they can all contribute to panic attacks.'}, {'complications': ' panic disorder is a treatable condition, but to make a full recovery it’s very important you seek medical help as soon as possible. this is because treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it’s given at an early stage. left undiagnosed and untreated, panic disorder can become a debilitating and isolating illness. it can also increase your risk of developing other psychological conditions.'}, {'agoraphobia and other phobias': ' agoraphobia\xa0is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong. if you have agoraphobia, leaving home, going out in public and travelling alone can cause intense anxiety. many people with agoraphobia avoid everyday activities because of their phobia. agoraphobia is\xa0one of the\xa0conditions that can develop alongside panic disorder. people with panic disorder can develop agoraphobia because of their fear of having a panic attack in a public place. you may worry that a panic attack in a public place will be embarrassing, or that you’ll have difficulty getting help if you need it. you may also worry about public places that you would have difficulty leaving, such as a train, if you were to have a panic\xa0attack. if you have agoraphobia, you may find it difficult to leave the house, particularly if you’re not with a trusted family member or a friend. if you have panic disorder, you may also develop other fears and\xa0phobias, which can often seem irrational. for example, you may start to worry about a particular object or action that triggers your attacks and become fearful of those things.'}, {'children': ' panic disorder is more common in teenagers than in younger children. panic attacks can be particularly debilitating for children and young people. severe panic disorder may affect their development and learning. the fear of having a panic attack may stop children from going to school and engaging in a social life. they may also find it difficult to concentrate on their schoolwork. diagnosing panic disorder\xa0in children is usually a case of taking a detailed medical history and carrying out a thorough physical examination\xa0to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms. screening for other anxiety disorders may also be needed to help determine what’s causing your child’s panic attacks. panic attacks in children are often dramatic events, including screaming and crying and an increased breathing rate (hyperventilation). if your child displays the signs and symptoms of panic disorder over a prolonged period of time, your gp may refer them to a specialist for further assessment and treatment. the specialist may recommend a course of psychotherapy\xa0for your child, such as\xa0cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt).'}, {'drug and alcohol misuse': ' some studies have shown that conditions that cause intense anxiety, such as panic disorder, can also increase your risk of developing an alcohol or drug problem. the side effects or withdrawal symptoms of both prescribed medication and\xa0illegal drugs can increase the symptoms of anxiety. smoking and caffeine can also make your anxiety symptoms worse, so you should try to\xa0give up smoking (if you smoke) and limit the amount of caffeine in your diet.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been received'}]"

(drug-induced parkinsonism) – where symptoms develop after taking certain medications, such as some types of antipsychotic medication, and usually improve once the medication is stopped other progressive brain conditions – such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple systems atrophy, and\xa0corticobasal degeneration cerebrovascular disease – where a series of small strokes cause several parts of the brain to die you can read more about parkinsonism on the parkinson’s uk website.'}, {'diagnosing parkinson’s disease': ' no tests can conclusively show that you have parkinson’s

neurologist – a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system a geriatrician – a specialist in problems affecting elderly people if your gp thinks you may be in the early stages of parkinson’s disease, you should see a specialist within six weeks. if they think you may be in the later stages, you should see a specialist within two weeks. the specialist will most likely ask you to perform a number of physical exercises so they can assess whether you have any problems with movement. a diagnosis of parkinson’s disease is likely if you have at least two of the three following symptoms:shaking or tremor in a part of your body that usually only occurs at rest slowness of movement (bradykinesia) muscle stiffness (rigidity) if your symptoms improve after taking a medication called levodopa, it’s more likely you have parkinson’s disease. special brain scans, such as a\xa0single photon emission computed tomography (spect) scan, may also be carried out in some cases\xa0to

visit your gp if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after\xa0the traumatic experience, or if\xa0the symptoms are\xa0particularly troublesome. your gp will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. they’ll ask whether you’ve experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you’ve re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares. your gp can refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you’d benefit from treatment. see\xa0treating ptsd for more information.'}, {'causes': ' post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or after a prolonged traumatic experience. types of events that can lead to ptsd include:serious road accidents violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis a diagnosis of a life-threatening condition an unexpected severe injury or death of a close family member\xa0or friend ptsd\xa0isn’t usually related to\xa0situations that are simply upsetting, such as divorce, job loss or failing exams. ptsd develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. it isn’t fully understood why some people develop the condition while others don’t. however, certain factors appear to make some people more likely to develop ptsd. if you’ve had\xa0depression or\xa0anxiety in the past, or you don’t receive much support from family or friends, you’re more susceptible to developing ptsd after a traumatic event. there may also be a genetic factor involved in ptsd. for example, having a parent with a mental health problem\xa0is thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.'}, {'possible causes': ' although it’s not clear exactly why people develop ptsd, a number of possible reasons have been suggested. these are described below.'}, {'treatment': ' the main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) are psychotherapy and medication. traumatic\xa0events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and seeking professional help is often the only way of effectively treating ptsd. it’s possible for ptsd to be\xa0successfully treated many years after the traumatic event occurred, which means it’s never too late to seek help.'}, {'assessment': ' before having treatment for\xa0ptsd, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs. your gp will often carry out an initial assessment, but you’ll be referred to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment\xa0if\xa0you’ve had symptoms of ptsd for more than four weeks or your symptoms are severe. there are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have ptsd, such as:a psychologist – an expert in how the mind works a community psychiatric nurse – a nurse who specialises in mental healthcare a psychiatrist – a mental health specialist who diagnoses and treats mental health conditions'}, {'watchful waiting': ' if you have mild symptoms of ptsd, or you’ve had symptoms for less than four weeks, an approach called watchful waiting may be recommended. watchful waiting involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse. it’s\xa0sometimes recommended because 2 in every 3 people who\xa0develop problems after a traumatic experience get better within a few weeks without treatment. if watchful waiting is recommended, you should have a follow-up appointment within one month.'}, {'psychotherapy': ' if you have ptsd that requires treatment, psychotherapy\xa0is usually recommended first. a combination of\xa0psychotherapy and medication may be recommended\xa0if you have severe or persistent ptsd. psychotherapy\xa0is a type of therapy often\xa0used to\xa0treat emotional problems and mental health conditions such as ptsd, depression, anxiety\xa0and obsessive compulsive disorder. the treatment\xa0is carried out by\xa0trained mental health professionals who listen to you and help\xa0you come up\xa0with effective strategies to resolve your problems. the main types of psychotherapy used to treat people with ptsd are described below.'}, {'medication': ' antidepressants such as\xa0paroxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, amitriptyline or phenelzine\xa0are sometimes used to treat ptsd in adults. of these medications, paroxetine and sertraline are the only ones licensed specifically for the treatment of ptsd. however, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and phenelzine have also been found to be effective and may be\xa0recommended as well. however, these\xa0medications will only be used if:you choose not to have trauma-focused psychological treatment psychological treatment wouldn’t be effective because there’s an ongoing threat of further trauma (such as domestic violence) you’ve gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment you have an underlying medical condition, such as severe depression, that significantly affects your ability to benefit from psychological treatment amitriptyline or phenelzine will usually only be used under the supervision of a mental health specialist. antidepressants\xa0can also be prescribed to reduce any associated symptoms of depression and anxiety and to help with sleeping problems. however,\xa0they’re not usually prescribed\xa0for people younger than\xa018 unless recommended by a specialist. if medication for ptsd is effective, it’s usually be continued for a minimum of 12 months before being gradually withdrawn over the course of four weeks or longer. if a medication\xa0isn’t effective at reducing your symptoms,\xa0your dosage may be increased. before prescribing a medication, your doctor should inform you about possible side effects you may have while taking it, along with any possible withdrawal symptoms when the medication is withdrawn. for example, common\xa0side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea. possible withdrawal symptoms associated with paroxetine include sleep disturbances, intense dreams, anxiety and irritability. withdrawal symptoms are less likely if the medication is reduced slowly.'}, {'complex ptsd': ' complex ptsd may be diagnosed in adults or children who have repeatedly experienced traumatic events,

pressure ulcers,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/pressure-ulcers/,"[{'about pressure ulcers': ' pressure ulcers are an injury that breaks down the skin and underlying tissue. they are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure. they are sometimes known as “bedsores” or “pressure sores”. pressure ulcers can range in severity from patches of discoloured skin to open wounds that expose the underlying bone or muscle. read more about the symptoms of pressure ulcers.'}, {'how pressure ulcers develop': ' pressure\xa0ulcers can\xa0develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. they can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time. the extra pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin. without a blood supply, the affected skin becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming. pressure ulcers tend to affect people with health conditions that make it difficult to move, especially\xa0those confined to lying in\xa0a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time. conditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such as type 2 diabetes, can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. learn more\xa0about the\xa0causes of pressure ulcers.'}, {'who is affected?': ' it’s estimated that just under half a million people in the uk will develop at least 1\xa0pressure ulcer in any given year. this is usually people with an underlying health condition – for example, around\xa01 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with a sudden illness will develop a pressure ulcer. people over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin.'}, {'treating and preventing pressure ulcers': ' treatment for pressure ulcers includes the use of dressings, creams and gels designed to speed up the healing process and relieve pressure. surgery is sometimes recommended for the most serious cases. for some people, pressure ulcers are an inconvenience that require minor nursing care. for others, they can be serious\xa0and lead to life-threatening complications, such as blood poisoning or\xa0gangrene. read more about the complications of pressure ulcers. pressure ulcers can be unpleasant, upsetting and challenging to treat. therefore, a range of techniques\xa0is used to prevent them developing in the first place. these include:regularly changing a person’s position using equipment to protect vulnerable parts of the body – such as specially designed mattresses and cushions read about\xa0treating pressure ulcers and\xa0preventing pressure ulcers for more information. unfortunately, even with the highest standards of care, it’s not always possible to prevent pressure ulcers in particularly vulnerable people.'}, {'symptoms of pressure ulcers': ' the parts of the body most at risk of developing pressure ulcers are those that are not covered by a large amount of body fat and are in direct contact with a supporting surface, such as a bed or a wheelchair. for example, if you are unable to get out of bed, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on your:shoulders or shoulder blades elbows back of your head rims of your ears knees, ankles, heels or toes spine tail bone (the small bone at the bottom of your spine) if you are a wheelchair user, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on:your buttocks the back of your arms and legs the back of your hip bone'}, {'severity\xa0of pressure ulcers': ' healthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe the severity of pressure ulcers. the most common is the european pressure ulcer advisory panel (epuap) grading system. the higher the grade, the more severe the injury to the skin and underlying tissue.'}, {'causes of pressure ulcers': ' pressure ulcers are caused by sustained pressure being placed on a particular part of the body. this pressure interrupts the blood supply to the affected area of skin. blood contains oxygen and other nutrients that are needed to help keep tissue healthy. without a constant blood supply, tissue is\xa0damaged\xa0and will eventually die. the lack of blood supply also means that the skin no longer receives infection-fighting white blood cells. once an ulcer has developed, it can become infected by bacteria. people with normal mobility do not develop pressure ulcers, as their body automatically makes hundreds of regular movements that prevent pressure building up on any part of their body. for example, you may think that you are lying still when asleep, but you may shift position up to 20 times a night. pressure ulcers can be caused by:pressure from a hard surface – such as a bed or wheelchair pressure that is placed on the skin through involuntary muscle movements – such as muscle spasms moisture – which can break down the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) the time it takes for a pressure ulcer to form will depend on:the amount of pressure how vulnerable a person’s skin is to damage grade 3\xa0or 4\xa0pressure ulcers can develop quickly. for example, in susceptible people, a full-thickness pressure ulcer can sometimes develop in just 1\xa0or 2\xa0hours. however, in some cases, the damage will only become apparent a few days after the injury has occurred.'}, {'diagnosing pressure ulcers': ' pressure ulcers are easily diagnosed by looking at them. however, health professionals prefer to prevent ulcers developing in the first place, so it’s important to assess a person’s risk of developing them. as part of the risk assessment process, the following will be considered:your general health your ability to move whether you have any problems that may affect your posture whether you have any symptoms that may indicate an infection your mental health whether you have had pressure ulcers in the past whether you have\xa0urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence your diet how well your blood circulation system is working as part of the risk assessment, you may be referred for blood and urine tests.\xa0blood tests can be a good way of assessing your general state of health and whether your diet is providing enough nutrition. urine tests can be used to check how well your kidneys are working and whether you have a urinary tract infection, which can be a cause\xa0for concern if you are incontinent or if you have had spinal damage.'}, {'self-assessment': ' if you are thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, but you are not staying in a hospital or care home, you may be advised to regularly\xa0check for early signs of the condition. look out for areas of discolouration and patches of skin that feel unusually spongy or tough to the touch. use a mirror to check parts of your body that can be difficult to see, such as your back or buttocks. contact your gp or your healthcare team if you notice any signs of damage.'}, {'treating pressure ulcers': ' treatment for pressure ulcers can vary, depending on the grade of the ulcer. treatment options may include regularly changing your position, or using special mattresses and dressings to relieve pressure or protect the skin. in some cases, surgery may be needed.'}, {'your care team': ' pressure ulcers are a complex health problem arising from many interrelated factors. therefore, your care may be provided by a team comprising different types of healthcare professionals. this type of team is sometimes known as a multidisciplinary team (mdt). your mdt may include:a tissue viability nurse (a nurse who specialises in wound care and prevention) a social worker a physiotherpist an occupational therapist a dietitian medical and surgical experts with experience in pressure ulcer management'}, {'changing position': ' it’s important to avoid putting pressure on areas that are vulnerable to pressure ulcers or where pressure ulcers have already formed. moving and regularly changing your position helps to prevent pressure ulcers developing and relieves the pressure on\xa0the ulcers that have developed. after your risk assessment is completed, your care team will draw up a “repositioning timetable”, which states how often you need to be moved. for some people, this may be as often as once every 15 minutes. others may need to be moved only once every 2\xa0hours. the risk assessment will also consider the most effective way of avoiding putting any vulnerable areas of skin under pressure whenever possible. you may also be given training and advice about:correct sitting and lying positions how you can adjust your sitting and lying position how often you need to move or be moved how best to support your feet how to maintain good posture the special equipment you should use and how to use it'}, {'mattresses and cushions': ' there are a range of special mattresses and cushions that can relieve pressure on vulnerable parts of the body. your care team will discuss the types of mattresses and cushions most suitable for you. those\xa0thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, or who have pre-existing grade 1\xa0or 2\xa0pressure ulcers, usually benefit from a\xa0specially designed foam mattress, which relieves the pressure on their body. people with a grade 3\xa0or 4\xa0pressure ulcer will require a more sophisticated mattress or bed system. for example, there are mattresses that can be connected to a constant flow of air, which is automatically regulated to reduce pressure as and when required.'}, {'dressings': ' specially designed dressings and bandages\xa0can be used to protect pressure ulcers and speed up the healing process. examples of these types of dressings include:hydrocolloid dressings –\xa0these contain a special gel that encourages the growth of new skin cells in the ulcer, while keeping the surrounding healthy area of skin dry alginate dressings –\xa0these are made from seaweed and contain sodium and calcium, which are known to speed up the healing process'}, {'creams and ointments': ' topical preparations, such as creams and ointments, can be used to help speed up the healing process and prevent further tissue damage.'}, {'antibiotics': ' if you have a pressure ulcer, you will not routinely be prescribed antibiotics. these are usually only prescribed to treat an infected pressure ulcer and prevent the infection from spreading. antiseptic cream may also be applied directly to pressure ulcers to clear out any bacteria that may be present.'}, {'nutrition': ' certain dietary supplements, such as protein, zinc and vitamin c, have been shown to accelerate wound healing. if your diet lacks these vitamins and minerals, your skin may be more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers. as a result of this, you may be referred to a dietitian so that a suitable dietary plan can be drawn up for you.'}, {'debridement': ' in some cases, it may be necessary to remove dead tissue from the ulcer to help stimulate the healing process. this procedure is known as debridement. if there is a small amount of dead tissue, it may be possible to remove it using specially designed dressings and paste. larger amounts of dead tissue may be removed using mechanical means. some mechanical debridement techniques include:cleansing and pressure irrigation –\xa0where dead tissue is removed using high-pressure water jets ultrasound – dead tissue is removed using low-frequency energy waves laser –\xa0dead tissue is removed using focused beams of light surgical debridement –\xa0dead tissue is removed using surgical instruments, such as scalpels and forceps a\xa0local anaesthetic will be used to numb the area of skin and tissue around the ulcer so that debridement does not cause any pain or discomfort.'}, {'maggot therapy': ' maggot therapy, also known as larvae therapy, is an alternative method of debridement. maggots are ideal for debridement because they feed on dead and infected tissue without touching healthy tissue. they also help to fight infection by releasing substances that kill bacteria and stimulate the healing process. during maggot therapy, the maggots are mixed into a wound dressing and the area is covered with gauze. after a few days, the dressing is taken off and the maggots are removed. many people may find the idea of maggot therapy off-putting, but research has found that it is often more effective than more traditional methods of debridement.'}, {'surgery': ' it’s not always possible for a grade 3\xa0or 4\xa0pressure ulcer to heal. in such cases, surgery will be required to seal the wound and prevent any further tissue damage occurring. surgical treatment involves cleaning the wound and closing it by bringing together the edges of the wound (direct closure), or by using tissue moved from a nearby part of the body (flap reconstruction). pressure ulcer surgery can be challenging, especially because most people who have the procedure are already in a poor state of health. there is a risk of a large number of possible complications occurring after surgery, including:infection tissue death of the implanted flap muscle weakness blisters\xa0(small pockets of fluid that develop inside the skin) recurrence of the pressure ulcers blood poisoning infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) internal bleeding abscesses\xa0(painful collections of pus that develop inside the body) deep vein thrombosis\xa0(a blood clot that develops inside the veins of the leg) despite the risks, surgery is often a necessity to prevent life-threatening complications, such as blood poisoning and gangrene (the decay or death of living tissue).'}, {'complications of pressure ulcers': ' even with the best possible medical care, complications can arise from grade 3\xa0or grade 4\xa0pressure ulcers and can occasionally be life-threatening. these complications are discussed below.'}, {'cellulitis': ' infection can spread from the site of the pressure ulcer to a deeper layer of skin. this type of infection is called cellulitis. it causes symptoms of pain and redness, plus swelling of the skin. it will need to be treated with a course of antibiotics. read more information\xa0about\xa0cellulitis. left untreated, there is a risk that the infection can spread to the blood (see below) or the underlying bone or joint. in rare cases, where pressure ulcers involve the lower back, tail bone and spine, the pressure ulcer can spread to the membranes that surround the spine and brain. this is known as meningitis.'}, {'blood poisoning': ' if a person with a weak immune system has a pressure ulcer that becomes infected, there is a risk that the infection will spread into their blood and other organs. this is known as blood poisoning or septicaemia. in the most serious cases of blood poisoning, damage to multiple organs can lead to a large drop in blood pressure, known as septic shock, which can be fatal. symptoms include cold skin and an increased heart beat. blood poisoning is a medical emergency. it requires immediate treatment in an intensive care unit (icu), so that the functions of the body can be supported while the infection is treated with antibiotics or antiviral medication. read more information\xa0about\xa0blood poisoning.'}, {'bone and joint infection': ' infection can also spread from a pressure ulcer into underlying joints (septic arthritis) and bones (osteomyelitis). both of these infections can damage the cartilage, tissue and bone. they may also affect the joints and limbs. antibiotics are required to treat bone and joint infections. in the most serious of cases, infected bones and joints may need to be surgically removed.'}, {'necrotising fasciitis': ' necrotising fasciitis, commonly known as “flesh-eating” bacteria, is a serious skin infection that causes rapid tissue death. it can occur when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with a particular type of bacteria,\xa0such as\xa0group a streptococci. emergency treatment is required. it involves a combination of antibiotics and surgical debridement of the dead tissue.'}, {'gas gangrene': ' gas gangrene is a serious but rare form of infection that occurs when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with the clostridium bacteria. the bacteria thrive in environments where there is little or no oxygen. they produce gases and release dangerous toxins. symptoms of gas gangrene include severe pain and rapid swelling of the skin. gas gangrene requires immediate treatment with surgical debridement. in the most serious of cases, it may be necessary to amputate the affected body part to prevent the gangrene from spreading to the rest of the body.'}, {'preventing pressure ulcers': ' as part of your treatment plan, your care team will discuss with you the best way to prevent pressure ulcers. this will be based on your individual circumstances. however, you may find that the general advice outlined below is helpful.'}, {'changing position': ' making regular and frequent changes to your position is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. if a pressure ulcer has already developed, regularly changing position will help to avoid putting further pressure on it, and give the wound the best chance of healing. as a general rule, wheelchair users will need to change their position at least once every 15 to 30 minutes. people who are confined to bed will need to change their position at least once every 2\xa0hours. once you have developed a pressure ulcer, it’s important that you minimise or avoid putting any further pressure on it to give the wound the best chance of healing. if you are unable to change position yourself, a carer or relative will need to assist you. for more information and advice about positional changes, read about\xa0treating pressure ulcers.'}, {'nutrition': ' eating a healthy, balanced diet that contains an adequate amount of protein and a good variety of vitamins and minerals can help prevent skin damage and speed up the healing process. you may be referred to a dietitian so that a dietary plan can be drawn up for you. if you currently have a reduced appetite due to a pre-existing health condition, the following advice may be useful:try eating smaller meals throughout the day, rather than 2\xa0or 3\xa0larger meals. set a timetable for when you should eat, rather than waiting until you feel hungry. this should ensure that you receive the necessary nutrition. avoid drinking large amounts of fluids just before you are about to eat, as this will make you feel fuller than you actually are. if you find swallowing difficult, try drinking specially made nutritional drinks or puréed foods and soups. if you are a vegetarian, it’s important to eat high-protein alternatives to meat. cheese, yoghurt, peanut butter, custard, beans and nuts are all good sources of protein. read more information\xa0about\xa0healthy eating for more advice.'}, {'checking your skin': ' if you have known risk factors for pressure ulcers, it’s important that you check your skin on a daily basis for any signs of pressure ulcers, such as discoloured areas of skin. this is particularly important if you have an underlying condition, such as nerve damage or diabetes, which may dampen or numb feelings of pain in certain parts of your body. you can use a mirror to check the parts of your body that are difficult to see, such as your bottom and the heels of your feet. if you notice any damage, report it to your care team. if you are at home, contact your gp or community nurse. if you are in hospital or a nursing home, inform one of your nurses or carers.'}, {'quit smoking': ' if you are a smoker, giving up is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. smoking reduces the levels of oxygen in your blood. it also weakens your immune system,

prostate cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/prostate-cancer/,"[{'about prostate cancer': ' prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and anyone with a prostate in the uk. prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years. symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis). when this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied. these symptoms shouldn’t be ignored, but they do not mean you definitely have prostate cancer. it is more likely that they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as bph or prostate enlargement). read more about the symptoms of\xa0prostate cancer'}, {'what is the prostate?': ' the prostate is a small gland in the pelvis. about the size of a satsuma, it’s located between the penis and the bladder and\xa0surrounds the urethra. the main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. it produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen.'}, {'why does prostate cancer happen?': ' the causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. however, certain things\xa0can increase your risk of developing the condition. the chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. most cases develop in men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or older. for reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in men and anyone with a prostate of african-caribbean african descent. it’s less common in men and anyone with a prostate of asian descent. men and anyone with a prostate who have\xa0first-degree\xa0male relatives (such as a father or brother) affected by prostate cancer are also at a slightly increased risk. read more about the causes of prostate cancer'}, {'tests for prostate cancer': ' there is no single test for prostate cancer. all the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you. the most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are blood tests, a physical examination of your prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or dre) and a biopsy. the blood test, known as a\xa0prostate-specific antigen (psa) test, measures the level of psa and may help detect early prostate cancer. men and anyone with a prostate are not routinely offered psa tests to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable. this is because the psa blood test is not specific to prostate cancer. psa can be raised due to a large non-cancerous growth of the prostate (bph), a urinary tract infection or inflammation of the prostate, as well as prostate cancer. raised psa levels also cannot tell a doctor whether a man has life-threatening prostate cancer or not. this means a raised psa can lead to unnecessary tests and treatment. however, you can ask to be tested for prostate cancer once the benefits and risks have been explained to you. read more about\xa0diagnosing prostate cancer and psa screening for prostate cancer'}, {'how is prostate cancer treated?': ' in many cases,\xa0treatment is not immediately necessary. if the cancer is at an early stage and\xa0not causing symptoms, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ or ‘active surveillance’ may be adopted. this involves carefully monitoring your condition. some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages. treatments include surgically removing the prostate, radiotherapy and hormone therapy. some cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. if the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms. all treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, including erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. for this reason, many people choose to delay treatment until there is a risk the cancer might spread. newer treatments,\xa0such as\xa0high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu)\xa0or cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects.\xa0some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy. however, the long-term effectiveness of these treatments are not yet known. read more about treating prostate cancer'}, {'living with prostate cancer': ' as\xa0prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, you can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment. nevertheless, it can have an effect on your life. as well as causing physical problems such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, a diagnosis of prostate cancer can understandably make you feel anxious or depressed. you may find it beneficial to talk about the condition with your family, friends, a family doctor and other people with prostate cancer. financial support is also available if prostate cancer reduces your ability to work. read more about living with prostate cancer'}, {'symptoms of prostate cancer': ' prostate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra. this normally results in problems associated with urination. symptoms can include:needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night needing to rush to the toilet difficulty in starting to pee (hesitancy) straining or taking a long time while urinating weak flow feeling that your bladder has not emptied fully your prostate may\xa0get larger as you get older due to a non-cancerous condition known as prostate

more common among men and anyone with a prostate of african-caribbean and african descent than\xa0in men and anyone with a prostate of asian descent family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it; having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing\xa0prostate cancer obesity – there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer exercise – men and anyone with a prostate who regularly exercises have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer; a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer in addition, some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in\xa0men and anyone with a prostate who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene, found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit, and selenium, found in brazil nuts. however, more research is needed. read further information:prostate cancer uk: who is at risk of prostate cancer cancer research uk:

prostate cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.'}, {'psa testing': ' psa is a protein produced by the prostate gland. all men and anyone with a prostate have a small amount of psa in their blood, and it increases with age. prostate cancer can increase the production of psa, and so a psa test looks for raised levels of psa in the blood that may\xa0be a sign of the condition\xa0in its early stages. however, psa testing is not a specific test for prostate cancer. most men and anyone with a prostate who has prostate cancer will not have a raised psa level. most people\xa0with a raised psa level will not have cancer, as psa levels rise in all men and anyone with a prostate as they get older. read more about psa screening for prostate cancer'}, {'digital rectal examination (dre)': ' the next step is a dre, which can be done by your gp. during a dre, your gp will insert a lubricated and gloved finger into your rectum. the rectum is close to your prostate gland, so your gp can check to feel if the surface of the gland has changed. this will feel a little uncomfortable, but should not be painful. prostate cancer can make the gland\xa0hard and bumpy. however, in most cases, the cancer causes no changes to the gland and a dre may not be able to detect the cancer. dre is useful in ruling out\xa0prostate enlargement caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, as this causes the gland to feel firm and smooth.'}, {'biopsy': ' your gp will assess your risk of having prostate cancer based on a number of factors, including your psa levels, the results of your dre, and your age, family history and ethnic group. if you are at risk, you\xa0should be referred to hospital to discuss the options of further tests. the most commonly used test is a transrectal ultrasound-guided\xa0biopsy (trus). a biopsy may also be taken during a cystoscopy examination or through the skin behind the testicles (perineum). during a trus biopsy, an ultrasound probe (a machine that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your body) is inserted into your rectum. this allows the doctor or specialist nurse to see exactly where to pass a needle through the wall of your rectum to take small samples of tissue from your prostate. the procedure can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, so you may be given a local anaesthetic to minimise any discomfort. as with any procedure, there may be complications, including bleeding and infection. although it is more reliable than a psa test, the trus biopsy\xa0can have\xa0problems. it can miss up to 1 in 5 cancers, because the location of the cancer is unknown when it is carried out. the doctors can see the prostate using the ultrasound scan, but not the tumour(s) if they are present. you may need another biopsy if your symptoms persist, or your psa level continues to rise. your doctor may\xa0request an mri scan of the prostate before another biopsy. the trus biopsy can also find small low-risk cancers that do not need treatment, but may cause you anxiety. many people often choose to undergo surgery or radiotherapy that may not benefit them but causes side effects, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. the samples of tissue from the biopsy are studied in a laboratory. if cancerous cells are found, they can be studied further to see how quickly the cancer will spread. this process is known as ‘staging and grading’ and helps doctors to decide which treatment is the most appropriate. read further information:cancer research uk: the stages of prostate cancer

recommended. these include:a\xa0magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or computerised tomography (ct) scan – these scans build a detailed picture of the inside of your body an isotope bone scan – this can

proved that the benefits would outweigh the risks.'}, {'psa screening': ' routinely screening all men and anyone with a prostate to check their prostate-specific antigen (psa) levels is a controversial subject in the international medical community. there are several reasons for this:psa tests are unreliable and can suggest prostate cancer when no cancer exists (a false-positive result) – this means that many men often have invasive and sometimes painful biopsies for no reason the psa test can find aggressive prostate cancer that needs treatment, but it can also find slow-growing cancer that may never cause symptoms or shorten life\xa0–\xa0some men and anyone with a prostate may therefore face difficult decisions about treatment treating prostate cancer in its early stages can be beneficial in some cases but the\xa0side effects of the various treatments are potentially so serious that men may choose to delay treatment until it is absolutely necessary although screening has been shown to reduce a man’s chance of dying from prostate cancer, it would mean many people receive treatment unnecessarily more research is needed to determine whether a screening programme would provide men and anyone with a prostate with more benefit than harm. one european study showed deaths from prostate cancer could be reduced by 20% if there was a screening programme, but this needs to be balanced against the harms of:overdiagnosis –\xa0people being diagnosed with a cancer\xa0that will never cause symptoms or death during their lifetime overtreatment –\xa0people being treated unnecessarily for tumours that would be\xa0unlikely to\xa0be harmful'}, {'improving the test': ' as there are many reasons why psa levels may be high at any one time, researchers are trying to make the psa test, or a variation of it, more accurate. this includes looking at how psa levels change over time and comparing the psa level to prostate size. researchers are also looking at whether new imaging tests, such as mri scans, or other blood and urine tests, can be used to decide which people with an elevated psa should have a biopsy. instead of a national screening programme, there is an informed choice programme called prostate cancer risk management for healthy men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or over who ask their gp about psa testing. it aims to give men and anyone with a prostate good information on the pros and cons of a psa test. if you’re aged\xa050 or over with a prostate and decide to have your psa levels tested after talking to your gp, they\xa0will be able to arrange for it to be carried out for free on the nhs. if results show you have a\xa0raised level of psa, your gp may suggest further tests.'}, {'should i have a psa test?': ' because the results of the psa test are not as reliable as doctors would like, other tests and investigations are needed to diagnose prostate cancer. a psa test cannot identify prostate cancer on its own, and changes in psa levels alone are not a good reason to start treatment. if you are thinking about asking for a psa test, it is important that you first discuss whether it is right for you\xa0with your gp so you understand what the results might mean. the prostate cancer risk management programme has information on the risks and benefits of the psa test to help you decide whether or not to have it.'}, {'treating prostate cancer': ''}, {'staging of prostate cancer': ' doctors will use the results of your prostate examination, biopsy and scans to identify the\xa0‘stage’ of your prostate cancer (how far the cancer has spread). the stage of the cancer will determine which types of treatments will be necessary. a widely used method of staging is\xa0a\xa0number staging system. the stages are:stage 1 – the cancer is very small and completely within the prostate gland stage 2 – the cancer is within the prostate gland, but is larger stage 3 – the cancer has spread from the prostate and may have grown into the tubes that carry semen stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes or another part of the body, including the bladder, rectum or bones; about 20 to 30% of cases are diagnosed at this stage if prostate cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of survival are generally good. read further information:cancer research uk: the stages of prostate cancer'}, {'watchful waiting': ' watchful waiting\xa0is often recommended for older men and anyone with a prostate when it is unlikely that the cancer\xa0will affect your natural life span. if the cancer is in its early stages and not causing symptoms, you may decide to delay treatment, and wait to see if any symptoms of progressive cancer develop. if this happens, pain medication and hormone medication to control prostate cancer are usually used. watchful waiting may also be recommended for people with a higher risk of prostate cancer if:your general health means you are unable to receive\xa0any form of treatment your life expectancy means you will die with the cancer rather than from it in this case, hormone treatment may be started if there are symptoms caused by the prostate cancer.'}, {'active surveillance': ' active surveillance aims to avoid unnecessary treatment of harmless cancers, while still providing timely treatment for men and anyone with a prostate who needs it. when they are diagnosed, around half to two-thirds of men and anyone with a prostate with low-risk prostate cancer do not need\xa0treatment. surveillance is a safe strategy that provides a period of observation to gather extra information over time to see whether the disease is changing. active surveillance involves you having regular psa tests and\xa0often several\xa0biopsies to ensure\xa0any signs of progression are found as early as possible. sometimes, mri scans may also be carried out. if these tests reveal the cancer is changing or progressing,\xa0you can then make a decision about further treatment. about 1 in 3 people who undergo surveillance will later have treatment. this does not mean they made the wrong initial decision. good evidence shows\xa0that active surveillance is safe over an average of 6 years. men undergoing active surveillance\xa0will have delayed any treatment-related side effects, and those who eventually need treatment\xa0will be reassured\xa0that it was necessary.'}, {'radical prostatectomy': ' a radical prostatectomy is the surgical removal of your prostate gland. this treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer. like any operation, this surgery carries some risks, and there may be some side effects:some people have problems with urinary incontinence\xa0– this can range from leaking small drips of urine, to leaking larger amounts but this usually clears up within 3 to 6 months of the operation some men have problems getting an erection (erectile dysfunction) – this sometimes improves with time, but around half will have long-term problems in extremely rare cases, problems arising after surgery can be fatal for many men and anyone with a prostate, having a radical prostatectomy will get rid of the cancer cells. however, for around 1 in 3 people, the cancer cells may not be fully removed, and the cancer cells may return sometime after the operation. radiotherapy after prostate removal surgery may increase the chances of a cure, although research is still being carried out into when it should be used after surgery. after a radical prostatectomy, you will no longer ejaculate during sex. this means\xa0that you will not be able to have a child through sexual intercourse. you may want to ask your doctors about storing a sperm sample before the operation, so\xa0it can be used later for in vitro fertilisation (ivf). read further information:macmillan: surgery for early prostate cancer'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy\xa0involves using radiation to kill cancerous cells. this treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer. radiotherapy can also be used to slow the progression of metastatic prostate cancer and relieve symptoms. radiotherapy is normally given as an outpatient at a hospital near you. it is done in short sessions for 5 days a week, for 4 to 8 weeks. there are short-term and long-term side effects associated with radiotherapy. you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of successful treatment. hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning. short-term effects of radiotherapy can include:discomfort around the rectum and anus (the opening through which stools pass out of your body) diarrhoea loss of pubic hair tiredness cystitis – an inflammation of the bladder lining, which can cause you to urinate frequently; urination may be painful possible long-term side effects can include:an inability to obtain an erection urinary incontinence back passage problems (diarrhoea, bleeding, discomfort) as with radical prostatectomy, there is a 1 in3 chance the cancer will return. in these cases, medication is usually used to control the cancer instead of surgery. this is because there is a higher risk of complications from surgery in men and anyone with a prostate who have previously had radiotherapy. some hospitals now offer new minimally invasive treatments if radiotherapy fails to work, sometimes\xa0as part of a clinical\xa0trial. these new treatments are called high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) and cryotherapy. these treatments have fewer side effects, but the long-term outcomes are not yet known. read further information:macmillan: radiotherapy for early prostate cancer'}, {'brachytherapy': ' brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where the radiation dose is delivered inside the prostate gland. it is also known as internal or interstitial radiotherapy. the radiation can be delivered using a number of tiny radioactive seeds that are surgically implanted into the tumour. this is called low dose-rate brachytherapy. the radiation can also be delivered through hollow, thin needles placed inside the prostate. this is called high dose-rate brachytherapy. this method has the advantage of delivering a high dose of radiation to the prostate, while minimising damage to other tissues. however, the risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary problems is the same as with radiotherapy, although the risk of bowel problems is slightly lower. read further information:cancer research uk: internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) for prostate cancer'}, {'hormone therapy': ' hormone therapy is often used in combination with radiotherapy. for example, you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of a successful treatment. hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning. hormone therapy alone should not normally be used to treat\xa0localised prostate cancer in\xa0people who are fit and willing to receive surgery or radiotherapy. this is because it does not cure the cancer on its own.\xa0hormone therapy\xa0can be used to slow the progression of advanced prostate cancer and relieve symptoms. hormones control the growth of cells in the prostate. in particular, prostate cancer needs the hormone testosterone to grow. the purpose of hormone therapy is to block the effects of testosterone, either by stopping its production or by stopping your body being able to use testosterone. hormone therapy can be given as:injections to stop your body making testosterone, called luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) agonists tablets to block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone, called anti-androgen treatment combined lhrh and anti-androgen treatment the main side effects of hormone treatment are caused by their effects on testosterone. they usually go away when treatment stops. they include\xa0loss of sex drive and erectile dysfunction (this is more common with lhrh agonists than anti-androgens). other possible side effects include:hot flushes sweating weight gain swelling and tenderness of the breasts an alternative to hormone therapy is to surgically remove the testicles, called orchidectomy. the operation does not cure prostate cancer, but by removing the testosterone, it controls the growth of the cancer and its symptoms. read further

cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer) and which is not responding to hormone therapy. chemotherapy destroys cancer cells by interfering with the way they multiply. chemotherapy does not cure prostate cancer, but can keep it under control and reduce symptoms (such as pain) so everyday life is less affected. the main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their effects on healthy cells, such as immune cells. they include infections, tiredness, hair loss, sore mouth, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. many of these side effects can be prevented or controlled with other medicines, which your doctor can prescribe for you.'}, {'steroids': ' steroid tablets are used when hormone therapy no longer works because the cancer is resistant

available if sildenafil is not effective. another alternative is a device called a vacuum pump. it is a simple tube connected to a pump. you place your penis in the tube and then pump out all the air.

event, known as a “trigger”. possible triggers of psoriasis include\xa0an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines. the condition isn’t contagious, so it can’t be spread from person to person. read more about the\xa0causes of psoriasis.'}, {'how psoriasis is diagnosed': ' a gp can\xa0often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin. in rare cases, a small sample of skin, called a biopsy, will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. this determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen planus, lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea. you may be referred to a dermatologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe. if your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specialises in arthritis). you may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and x-rays of the affected joints may be taken.'}, {'treating psoriasis': ' there’s no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches. in most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin d analogues or topical corticosteroids. topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin. if these aren’t effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light. in severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. these are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body. read more about treating psoriasis.'}, {'living with psoriasis': ' although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected. for example,\xa0some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. it’s also quite\xa0common\xa0to develop\xa0tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. this is known as psoriatic arthritis. speak to your gp or healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you\xa0have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. they\xa0can offer advice and further treatment if necessary. there are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such as the psoriasis association, where you can speak to other people with the condition. read more about living with psoriasis.'}, {'further information': ' you can find support and information from organisations like:changing faces – a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice the psoriasis association – provides support groups for people with psoriasis where you can speak to other people with the condition'}, {'symptoms of psoriasis': ' psoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness. there are several different types of psoriasis. many people have only\xa0one\xa0form of psoriasis at a time, although 2\xa0different types can occur together. one type may change into another type, or become more severe. most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping. you should see your gp if you think you may have psoriasis.'}, {'common types of psoriasis': ''}, {'pustular psoriasis': ' pustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body.'}, {'erythrodermic psoriasis': ' erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. this can cause intense itching or burning. erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection, dehydration, heart failure,\xa0hypothermia and malnutrition.'}, {'causes of psoriasis': ' psoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. it’s not known exactly why this happens, but research suggests it’s caused by a problem with the immune system. your body produces new skin cells in the deepest layer of skin. these skin cells gradually move up through the layers of skin until they reach the outermost level. then they die and flake off. this whole process normally takes around 3\xa0to 4\xa0weeks. in people with psoriasis, this process only takes about 3\xa0to 7\xa0days. as a result, cells that aren’t fully mature build up rapidly on the surface of the skin, causing red, flaky, crusty patches covered with silvery scales.'}, {'problems with the immune system': ' your immune system is your body’s defence against disease and it helps fight infection. one of the main types of cell used by the immune system is called a t-cell. t-cells normally travel through the body to detect and fight invading germs such as bacteria, but in people with psoriasis they start to attack healthy skin cells by mistake. this causes the deepest layer of skin to produce new skin cells more quickly than usual, which in turn triggers the immune system to produce more t-cells. it’s not known what exactly causes this problem with the immune system, although certain genes and environmental triggers may\xa0play a role.'}, {'genetics': ' psoriasis runs in families. 1\xa0in 3\xa0people with psoriasis has a close relative with the condition. however, the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. research studies have shown many different genes are linked to the development of psoriasis. it’s likely that different combinations of genes may make people more vulnerable to the condition. however, having these genes doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll develop it.'}, {'psoriasis triggers': ' many people’s psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger. knowing your triggers may\xa0help you to\xa0avoid a flare-up. common triggers include:an injury to your skin, such as a cut, scrape, insect bite or sunburn (this is known as the koebner response) drinking excessive amounts of alcohol smoking stress hormonal changes, particularly in women (for example, during\xa0puberty and the menopause) certain medicines\xa0such as\xa0lithium, some antimalarial medicines, anti-inflammatory medicines including ibuprofen, ace inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure) and\xa0beta blockers (used to treat congestive heart failure) throat infections – in some people, usually children and young adults, a form of psoriasis called guttate psoriasis develops after a streptococcal throat infection (although most people who have streptococcal throat infections don’t develop psoriasis) other immune disorders, such as hiv,\xa0which cause psoriasis to flare up or to appear for the first time psoriasis isn’t contagious, so it can’t be spread from person to person.'}, {'treating psoriasis': ''}, {'treatment overview': ' treatments are determined by the type and severity of your psoriasis and the area of skin affected. your\xa0doctor will probably start with a mild treatment, such as topical creams (which are applied to the skin), and then move on to stronger treatments if necessary. a\xa0wide range of treatments\xa0are available\xa0for psoriasis, but identifying which treatment is most effective can be difficult. talk to your\xa0doctor if you feel a treatment isn’t working or you have uncomfortable side effects. treatments fall into 3\xa0categories:topical – creams and ointments that\xa0are applied to your skin phototherapy – your skin is exposed to certain types of ultraviolet\xa0light systemic– oral and injected medications that work throughout the entire body often, different types of treatment are used in combination. your treatment for psoriasis may need to be reviewed regularly. you may want to make a care plan (an agreement between you and your health professional)\xa0as this can help you manage your day-to-day health. the various treatments for\xa0psoriasis are outlined below. you can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for psoriasis, allowing you to compare your treatment options.'}, {'topical treatments': ' topical treatments are usually the first treatments used for mild to moderate\xa0psoriasis. these are creams and ointments you apply to affected areas. some people find that topical treatments\xa0are all\xa0they\xa0need to control their condition, although\xa0it may take up to 6\xa0weeks before\xa0there’s a noticeable effect. if you\xa0have scalp psoriasis, a combination of shampoo and ointment may be recommended.'}, {'emollients': ' emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. if you have mild psoriasis, an emollient is probably the first treatment your gp will suggest. the main benefit of emollients is to reduce itching and scaling. some topical treatments are thought to work better on moisturised skin. it’s important to wait at least half an hour before applying a topical treatment after an emollient. emollients are available\xa0as a wide\xa0variety of products and can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy\xa0or prescribed by your gp, nurse or health visitor.'}, {'steroid creams or ointments': ' steroid creams or ointments (topical corticosteroids)\xa0are commonly used to treat mild to moderate psoriasis in\xa0most areas of the body. the treatment works by reducing inflammation. this slows the production of skin cells and reduces itching. topical corticosteroids range in strength from mild to very strong. only use topical corticosteroids when recommended by your doctor. stronger topical corticosteroids can be prescribed by your doctor and should only be used on small areas of\xa0skin or on particularly thick patches. overusing topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning.'}, {'vitamin d analogues': ' vitamin d analogue creams are commonly used along with or instead of\xa0steroid creams\xa0for mild to moderate psoriasis affecting areas such as the limbs, trunk or scalp. they work by slowing the production of skin cells. they also have an anti-inflammatory effect. examples of vitamin d analogues are calcipotriol, calcitriol and tacalcitol. there are very few side effects, as long as you don’t\xa0use more than the recommended amount.'}, {'calcineurin inhibitors': ' calcineurin inhibitors,\xa0such as\xa0tacrolimus and pimecrolimus,\xa0are ointments or creams that reduce the activity of the immune system and help to reduce inflammation. they’re sometimes used to treat psoriasis affecting sensitive areas (such as the scalp, the genitals and folds in the skin) if\xa0steroid creams\xa0aren’t effective. these medications can cause skin irritation or a burning and itching sensation when they’re started, but this usually improves within a week.'}, {'coal tar': ' coal tar is a thick, heavy oil and is probably the oldest treatment for psoriasis. how it works isn’t exactly known, but it can reduce scales, inflammation and itchiness. it may be used to treat psoriasis\xa0affecting the limbs, trunk or scalp if other topical treatments aren’t effective. coal tar can stain clothes and bedding, and has a strong smell. it can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).'}, {'dithranol': ' dithranol has been used for over 50 years to treat psoriasis. it has been shown to be effective in suppressing the production of skin cells and has few side effects. however, it\xa0can burn if too concentrated. it’s typically used as a short-term treatment for psoriasis affecting the limbs or trunk under hospital supervision, as it stains everything it comes into contact with, including skin, clothes and bathroom fittings. it’s applied to your skin (while wearing gloves) and left for 10\xa0to 60 minutes before being washed off. dithranol can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).'}, {'phototherapy': ' phototherapy uses natural and artificial light to treat psoriasis. artificial light therapy can be given in hospitals and some specialist centres, usually under the care of a dermatologist. these treatments aren’t the same as using a sunbed.'}, {'uvb phototherapy': ' ultraviolet b (uvb) phototherapy uses a wavelength of light that is invisible to human eyes. the light slows down the production of skin cells and is an effective treatment for some types of psoriasis that haven’t responded to topical treatments. each session only takes a few minutes, but you may need to go to hospital 2\xa0or 3\xa0times a week for 6\xa0to 8\xa0weeks.'}, {'psoralen plus ultraviolet a (puva)': ' for this treatment, you’ll first be given a tablet containing compounds called psoralens, or psoralen may be applied directly to the skin. this makes your skin more sensitive to light. your skin is then exposed to a wavelength of light called ultraviolet a (uva). this light penetrates your skin more deeply than ultraviolet b light. this treatment may be used if you have severe psoriasis that hasn’t responded to other treatment. side effects of the treatment include nausea, headaches, burning and itchiness. you may need to wear special glasses for 24 hours after taking the tablet to prevent the development of cataracts. long-term use of this treatment isn’t encouraged, as it can increase your risk of developing skin cancer.'}, {'combination light therapy': ' combining phototherapy with other treatments often increases its effectiveness. some doctors use uvb phototherapy in combination with coal tar, as the coal tar makes the skin more receptive to light. combining uvb phototherapy with dithranol cream may also be effective (this is known as ingram treatment).'}, {'systemic treatments': ' if your psoriasis is severe\xa0or other treatments haven’t worked, you may be prescribed systemic treatments by a specialist. systemic treatments are\xa0treatments that work throughout the entire body. these medications can be very effective in treating psoriasis, but they all have potentially serious side effects. all the systemic treatments for psoriasis have benefits and risks. before starting treatment, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and any risks associated with them. there are 2\xa0main types of systemic treatment, called non-biological (usually given as tablets or capsules) and biological (usually given as injections). these are described in more detail below.'}, {'non-biological medications': ''}, {'biological

important that you start treatment as soon as possible to improve your symptoms. if\xa0you already have\xa0an underlying condition, which is\xa0causing your pulmonary hypertension, this should be treated first. in some cases, this can prevent permanent damage to your pulmonary arteries. in the 1980s, people lived for an average of less than three years after being diagnosed with pah. now new medicines mean that people may be able to survive much longer. the course of the disease will depend on how quickly your condition is diagnosed, how advanced your symptoms are, and whether you have an\xa0underlying health condition.'}, {'symptoms of pulmonary hypertension': ' symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:shortness of breath fatigue (extreme tiredness) dizziness feeling faint chest pain (angina) a racing heartbeat (tachycardia) people with a particular type known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) may not experience any symptoms until their condition is already quite advanced.'}, {'quality of life': ' symptoms can become worse when you exercise, which may limit your ability to take part in physical activities. as your condition progresses, you may find it

the middle of the night gasping for breath (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea) a cough that will not go away nausea (feeling sick) lack of appetite weight loss confusion or difficulties in concentrating'}, {'causes of pulmonary hypertension': ' pulmonary hypertension is caused by changes to the pulmonary arteries, the vessels carrying blood from your heart to your lungs. the walls of your pulmonary arteries can become stiff and thickened, or may be blocked by something such as a blood clot. this makes it harder for your heart to push blood through these arteries, which increases the pressure inside the vessels and results in pulmonary hypertension. there can be many different reasons for the changes to your arteries. the world health organization (who) has classified pulmonary hypertension into five different types, depending on the underlying cause:pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease and hypoxia pulmonary hypertension due to blood clots pulmonary hypertension due to other causes'}, {'pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah)': ' pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is caused by problems with the smaller branches of the pulmonary arteries. in pah, these changes are usually the core medical problem, rather than a condition that has started somewhere else and then affected the pulmonary arteries. unlike the other types of pulmonary hypertension, pah can therefore be treated directly, while in other cases the underlying cause is treated first. pah is further divided into specific subtypes, outlined below.'}, {'persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn': ' this is a type of pulmonary hypertension estimated to affect\xa0two in every 1,000 newborn babies. it has been linked to the mother taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) during the third trimester of the pregnancy (week 27 to the birth). conditions that may also be associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn include:severe pulmonary hypoplasia\xa0– when your baby’s lungs are seriously underdeveloped hypoglycaemia\xa0– an abnormally low level of glucose in the baby’s blood sepsis\xa0– a life-threatening illness caused by the baby’s body overreacting to an infection meconium aspiration syndrome\xa0– when a newborn baby breathes in a mixture of amniotic fluid (which surrounds them in the womb) and meconium (their first faeces), which can block their airways'}, {'left heart disease': ' pulmonary hypertension may sometimes be associated with diseases affecting the left side of your heart (which pumps blood around the body). the left side of the heart is made up of:the left atria (upper chamber) the left ventricle (lower chamber) the aortic and mitral valves\xa0– one-way valves that allow blood to flow through the heart in the correct direction because blood goes from the pulmonary arteries to the lungs and then to the left side of the heart, any problem with the left side of the heart could have a backwards effect on this circuit and affect the pulmonary arteries. this in turn could cause pulmonary hypertension. for example, the mitral valve, which is located between the left atria and left ventricle, can become narrowed. if this happens, there will be a build-up of blood trying to get through the valve, which will increase blood pressure in the left atria. this could in turn increase pressure in the blood vessels between the lungs and the heart, and then feed back and increase pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to pulmonary hypertension. up to\xa060% of\xa0people with a condition causing severe left ventricle dysfunction have pulmonary

disease\xa0– a group of lung disorders that cause scarring of your lung tissue, making it difficult to get enough oxygen into your body –\xa0around a third of people with interstitial lung disease may have pulmonary hypertension sleep-disordered breathing\xa0– conditions that affect your breathing while you are in deep sleep, such as\xa0obstructive sleep apnoea these types of conditions can restrict the amount of oxygen that is getting into the lungs, and therefore into the blood. a low level of oxygen in the blood causes the pulmonary arteries to constrict (become narrower). because these vessels are narrower, the blood is squeezed into a smaller space, increasing the blood pressure and resulting in pulmonary hypertension.'}, {'blood clots': ' a foreign object, usually a blood

the pressure your heart must work against to get blood to your lungs (pulmonary vascular resistance) the amount of oxygen in the blood that returns to your heart if the pressure in your pulmonary arteries is above a certain level, you will be diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. if the above diagnostic tests reveal an underlying cause, you will be diagnosed with a particular type of pulmonary hypertension. if no cause is found, you will be diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.'}, {'treating pulmonary hypertension': ' if your pulmonary hypertension is caused by an underlying condition, your treatment will focus on tackling it. if the cause is treated early, it may be possible to prevent permanent damage to your pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels

ringworm, groin infections and athlete’s foot can be treated using an over-the-counter antifungal cream, gel or spray. there are lots of different types, so ask your pharmacist to help you choose the right one for you. you usually apply antifungal creams, gels and sprays daily to the affected areas of skin for 2 weeks. the cream, gel or spray should be applied over the rash and to one inch of skin beyond the edge of the rash. read the manufacturer’s instructions first. you may be advised to use the treatment for a further 2 weeks, to reduce the risk of re-infection. see your gp if your symptoms

because it could spread the infection to other parts of your body it’s important that other household members check themselves for signs of infection and get treatment if necessary. if you suspect that your pet is the source of the infection, take them to your vet for treatment. patches of missing fur is a sign that an animal has ringworm. always wash your hands after touching a pet with the infection. if someone in your family has a fungal infection, there is no need for them to stay off work or school. however, treatment should be started as soon as possible. good personal hygiene should also be followed to stop it spreading to other children. wearing something on your feet in gym and swimming pool changing rooms will reduce your chances of getting athlete’s foot. find out how

other at this time of year. it’s difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the uk. this is because many people don’t visit their gp and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines.'}, {'treating scabies': ' visit\xa0your gp if you think\xa0you have scabies.\xa0it’s not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. the 2\xa0most widely used treatments

lower buttocks the lower legs the soles of the feet the\xa0knees the shoulder blades the female genital area the groin around the ankles elderly people, young children and those with a low immune system (immunocompromised) may also develop a rash on their head and neck. men usually have 1\xa0or more very itchy, lumpy, 3 to 10mm spots on the skin of the genitals (on the penis\xa0and scrotum). in infants and young children, burrow marks tend to appear in different\xa0places on their body, including on\xa0the:face head neck scalp palms of the hands soles of the feet scabies mites leave small

burrows into your skin. male mites move between different burrow sites looking to mate. after mating, the male mite dies and the female begins to lay eggs, which\xa0hatch around 3\xa0to 4\xa0days later. after hatching, the young mites move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults after 10 to 15 days. male mites stay on the surface of the skin, while\xa0female mites burrow back into the skin to create a new burrow. the life cycle is then repeated. without effective treatment, the life cycle of the scabies mite can continue indefinitely. scabies mites are resistant to soap and hot water and can’t be scrubbed out of the skin.'}, {'how scabies is spread': ' scabies mites can’t fly or jump, which means they can only move from one human body to another if 2\xa0people have

sharing\xa0clothing, towels and bedding with an infected person (although\xa0this is rare) it’s unlikely that scabies will be transmitted through brief physical contact, such as shaking hands or hugging. scabies mites can survive outside the human body for 24 to 36 hours, making infection by coming into contact with contaminated clothes, towels\xa0or bed linen a possibility. however, it’s\xa0rare for someone to be infected in this way. scabies infestations can spread quickly because people are usually unaware\xa0they\xa0have the condition until 2\xa0to 3\xa0weeks after the initial infection. there’s an increased risk of catching scabies in confined environments, such as schools and nursing homes, where people are in close proximity to one another.'}, {'diagnosing scabies': ' your gp should be able to diagnose scabies from the appearance of your skin, and by looking for the burrow marks of the sarcoptes scabiei mite. however, as scabies\xa0is spread very easily, it’s often

or impetigo (a highly contagious bacterial skin infection). read more about the symptoms of scabies.'}, {'ink test': ' the burrows of scabies mites can be identified by using an ink test. ink is rubbed around an area of itchy skin before being wiped off with an alcohol pad. if scabies burrows are present, some of the ink will remain and will have tracked into the burrows, showing up as a dark line. to confirm the diagnosis, a skin sample may be gently scraped from the affected area so\xa0it can be examined under a microscope for evidence of scabies mites, their eggs and faeces (poo).'}, {'where to get help with scabies': ' visit your gp if you think you have scabies. if you think you have genital scabies or your partner has been diagnosed with it, visit your nearest sexual health clinic, where you’ll be examined and, if necessary, treated. if you decide to treat scabies yourself, you’ll need to have a full sexual health check to make sure you don’t have any\xa0sexually transmitted infections (stis). to prevent reinfection, it’s important that all members of your household are treated, as well as any sexual partners you’ve had over the last 6\xa0weeks (in the case of genital scabies). if you’ve had genital scabies in the past, anyone you’ve had sex with in the previous 48 hours will need to be treated. if you’re embarrassed about contacting previous sexual partners, your gp surgery or local sexual health clinic may be able to inform them that they’ve been exposed to scabies on your behalf without disclosing your identity.'}, {'sexual health clinics': ' some sexual health clinics operate on a walk-in basis. others work by\xa0appointment only. it’s therefore a good idea to call first. when you attend a clinic, you’ll be asked for your name, date of birth and contact details. these details will be treated confidentially and won’t be passed on to your gp without your agreement. you’ll also be asked about your sexual history, including:when you

{'crusted scabies': ' crusted scabies, also known as norwegian scabies, is a more severe form of scabies. this means thousands or even millions of scabies mites are present. normal scabies can develop into crusted scabies\xa0after a skin reaction. the condition affects all parts of the body, including your head, neck, nails and scalp. however, unlike normal scabies, the rash associated with crusted scabies usually doesn’t itch. in crusted scabies, the increase in the number of mites causes thick, warty crusts to develop on the skin. it’s often mistaken for psoriasis (a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales). crusted scabies affects people with a weakened immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and\xa0illness). this includes:the very young people with brain disorders (neurological disorders, such as parkinson’s disease) people with down’s syndrome pregnant women elderly people people with a condition that affects their immune system, such as\xa0hiv or aids people who are taking steroids to treat other medical conditions people who are having\xa0chemotherapy treatment research has found a healthy immune system appears to interrupt the reproductive cycle of the scabies mite. for example, most people with scabies will only have 5 to 15 mites on their body at any one time. however, if you have a weakened immune system, the number of scabies mites can increase significantly. people with crusted scabies can have thousands or millions of scabies mites on their body at any one time. because of\xa0the high number of scabies mites, crusted scabies is highly contagious. even minimal physical contact with a person with crusted scabies, or with their bed linen or clothes, can lead to infection. however, contact with\xa0someone with crusted scabies will\xa0only lead to the normal type of scabies in people with a healthy immune system. crusted scabies can be treated using insecticide creams or a medicine called ivermectin, which is taken by swallowing a tablet. ivermectin kills the mites by stopping their nervous system working.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your

hallucinations or delusions negative symptoms – represent a withdrawal or lack of function that you would usually expect to see in a healthy person; for example, people with schizophrenia often appear emotionless, flat and apathetic the condition\xa0may develop slowly. the first signs of schizophrenia, such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or experiencing changes in sleeping

other clothes not hanging properly a prominent ribcage a difference in leg lengths back pain\xa0is common in adults with scoliosis. young people with scoliosis may also experience some discomfort but it’s less likely to be severe.'}, {'when to get professional help': ' if you or your child\xa0have signs of scoliosis, make an appointment to see your gp.\xa0they can examine your back and can refer you for an x-ray\xa0for confirmation. if you or your child are diagnosed with scoliosis, it’s important to see a scoliosis specialist to talk about treatment options. read more about diagnosing scoliosis. rarely scoliosis can cause a condition called cauda equina syndrome to develop. cauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. if you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.'}, {'what causes scoliosis?': ' in around\xa0eight out of every 10 cases, a cause for scoliosis is not found. this is known as idiopathic scoliosis. a small number of cases are caused by other medical conditions, including:cerebral palsy\xa0–\xa0a condition\xa0 associated with brain damage muscular dystrophy\xa0– a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness marfan syndrome\xa0– a disorder of the connective tissues rarely, babies can be born with scoliosis,\xa0as a result of\xa0a problem with the development of the spine in the womb. in adults, age related changes in the discs and joints of the spine and a reduction in bone density may cause scoliosis. adults can also experience worsening over time of previously undiagnosed or untreated scoliosis. read more\xa0about the causes of scoliosis.'}, {'who is affected': ' it used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it’s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well. it can develop\xa0at any age, but is most common in children aged 10-15. in the uk, around three or four in every 1,000\xa0children\xa0need treatment for scoliosis. it’s more common in females than males.'}, {'how scoliosis is treated': ' treatment for scoliosis depends on your age,\xa0how severe it is, and whether it’s thought it will worsen with time. in very young children, treatment is not always necessary because the curvature of the spine may improve naturally as they get older. if treatment is necessary, bracing or casting may be used to attempt to halt the curve’s progression. if the infant or younger child’s curve continues to progress despite bracing or casting, an operation may be necessary. this will usually involve inserting metal rods into the back to stabilise the spine, which are lengthened at regular intervals as your child grows. in older children and adults, it is unlikely that scoliosis will improve with time, and in some it may progressively worsen. the main treatments for older children are:a back brace worn until they stop growing, to prevent the spine from curving further surgery to correct the curvature – where the spine is straightened using rods attached to the spine by screws, hooks and/or wires in adults, treatment primarily aims to relieve any pain. non-surgical options, such as painkillers and exercises are often tried first, with correctional surgery seen as a last resort. read more about treating scoliosis in children and treating scoliosis in adults.'}, {'further problems': ' scoliosis can sometimes lead to\xa0further emotional and physical problems. having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. this is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis. if this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, such as scoliosis association uk. these groups are a good source of\xa0information and support for people with scoliosis. in rare cases, scoliosis can lead to physical problems if it’s severe. for example, significant curvature of the spine can sometimes put increased pressure on the heart and lungs. read more about the possible complications of scoliosis.'}, {'causes of scoliosis': ' in most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown and it cannot usually be prevented. it is not\xa0thought to be linked\xa0with things such as bad posture, exercise or diet. if the cause of scoliosis is unknown,\xa0it is called idiopathic scoliosis. about eight out of every 10 cases of scoliosis are idiopathic. however, researchers have found\xa0there is\xa0a family history of the condition in some\xa0idiopathic cases,\xa0which suggests\xa0a possible genetic link. idiopathic scoliosis can affect adults and children.\xa0some cases\xa0may only become noticable\xa0in later life.'}, {'known causes': ' in a small number of cases, a cause is identified.'}, {'diagnosing scoliosis': ' scoliosis can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination of the spine, ribs, hips and shoulders. you may be asked to bend\xa0forward to see if any areas are\xa0particularly prominent. for example, one of your shoulders may be higher than the other or there may be a bulge in your back. initial examinations are usually carried out by a gp. if scoliosis is suspected, you should be referred to an orthopaedic specialist (a specialist in conditions that affect the skeleton) for further tests and to discuss treatment.'}, {'scans': ' the orthopaedic specialist will take an\xa0x-ray to confirm the diagnosis of scoliosis. the x-ray images will also help determine the shape, direction, location and angle of the curve. the medical name for the angle\xa0the spine curves\xa0is known as the cobb angle. in some cases,\xa0scans such as a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan\xa0or a\xa0computerised tomography (ct) scan\xa0may also be recommended.'}, {'treating scoliosis in children': ' if your child has scoliosis, their treatment will depend on their age and how severe it is. the main treatment options are:observation casting bracing surgery these are described below. there is a separate\xa0page\xa0about\xa0treating scoliosis in adults.'}, {'observation': ' treatment is not always necessary for very young children because their condition often corrects itself as they grow. however, if the curve does not correct itself, it can reduce the space for the internal organs to develop in, so careful monitoring by a specialist is important. your specialist will usually recommend having regular\xa0x-rays to monitor the curvature to see if it improves, stays the same, or gets worse.'}, {'casting': ' in some cases affecting young children, the spine may need to be guided during growth in an attempt to correct the curve. in a child aged under two years of age, this can sometimes be achieved by using a cast. a cast is an external brace to the trunk made out of a lightweight combination of plaster and modern casting materials. the cast is worn constantly and cannot be removed, but is changed regularly to allow for growth and remodelling. the cast will be changed under\xa0anaesthetic\xa0every two to three months with the aim of gradually straightening the spine. however, your child may still need to use a removable brace (see below) after treatment.'}, {'bracing': ' if the curve of your child’s spine is getting worse, your specialist may recommend they wear a back brace while they are growing. a brace cannot cure scoliosis or correct the curve, but it may stop the curve from getting worse. however, while there is some evidence bracing may be of benefit in certain cases, it’s not recommended by all scoliosis specialists. if a brace is used, it will need to be carefully fitted to your child’s spine. to do this, a cast of your child’s back may need to be taken. this can be done as an outpatient which means that your child will not have to stay overnight in hospital. braces are often made of rigid plastic, although flexible braces are sometimes available. in general, modern back braces are designed so they are difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing. it’s usually recommended that the brace is worn for 23 hours a day, and is only removed for baths and showers. the brace should not interfere with normal everyday activity and can be worn during most non-contact sports. however, it should be removed during contact sports and swimming. regular exercise is important for children wearing a brace. this helps improve muscle tone and body strength, and will help make wearing the brace more comfortable. the brace will usually have to be worn for as long as your child’s body is still growing. for most children, this will mean they can stop wearing it when they are around 16 or 17 years old.'}, {'surgery': ' if your child has stopped growing and their scoliosis is severe, or other treatments have been unsuccessful, corrective surgery may be recommended. they type of surgery will depend on your child’s age.'}, {'additional therapies': ' there is no reliable evidence to suggest that other therapies such as osteopathy and chiropractic can be used to correct the curvature of the spine or stop it progressing. the role of scoliosis specific exercises is currently under investigation. physiotherapy\xa0 may be beneficial when used in combination with a back brace. exercise can help significantly with any muscular pain experienced with scoliosis, and back health in general.'}, {'treating scoliosis in adults': ' back pain\xa0is one of the main problems caused by scoliosis in adults, so treatment is mainly aimed at pain relief. in some cases, surgery may be carried out to improve the shape of the spine as a way of helping with back and leg pains.'}, {'medication': ' painkilling medication is usually recommended\xa0to help relieve the pain\xa0that can be associated with scoliosis. over-the-counter painkillers, such as\xa0paracetamol\xa0and\xa0ibuprofen, are often recommended initially. see your gp if these don’t work. they may prescribe stronger painkillers or refer you to a specialist pain management clinic. in some cases,\xa0corticosteroids or\xa0local anaesthetic\xa0may be injected\xa0into your back to relieve pain caused by the bones in your spine\xa0compressing or irritating nearby nerves. however, these injections only\xa0work in the\xa0short-term and are mostly useful in helping work out where your pain is\xa0coming\xa0from. if it’s thought that\xa0osteoporosis of your spine is contributing to your symptoms, you may be given medication and supplements to strengthen your bones. read more about treating osteoporosis.'}, {'exercise': ' general strengthening and stretching exercises can\xa0improve your general posture and flexibility,\xa0and may help control any back pain. exercises can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which can reduce the strain on your back. some people may benefit from physiotherapy, where they are taught specific exercises to carry out.'}, {'bracing': ' braces are not often used to treat scoliosis in adults, although they can\xa0provide pain relief in some cases. a brace\xa0may be considered as an alternative to surgery if you are not well enough to undergo an operation.'}, {'surgery': ' surgery for adults with scoliosis is usually only recommended if the curve in the spine is severe, if it’s getting significantly worse, for back pain related to standing in an abnormal posture, or if the nerves in the spine are being compressed. there are two types of surgery:decompression\xa0surgery –\xa0if a disc or bone is pressing down on a nerve, it can be removed to reduce the pressure on the nerve spinal fusion surgery – where the position of the spine is\xa0improved using metal rods, plates and screws before being fused into place using bone grafts these are major operations\xa0and it can take up to a year or more to fully recover from them. they also carry a risk of potentially serious complications, including:failure\xa0to reduce\xa0pain\xa0– surgery is generally better at relieving pain that radiates to the legs, rather than back pain

if it’s left untreated.'}, {'emotional\xa0issues': ' having a visibly curved spine or\xa0wearing a back brace may cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. this is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis. modern back braces are designed to be\xa0difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing, but your child may still worry that they look different or unusual. encouraging your child to talk with other teenagers who have scoliosis can help\xa0improve their confidence and lessen any feelings they are alone with their condition. there are several support groups, such as the scoliosis association uk, that provide information and support for people with scoliosis. some also host message boards so\xa0teenagers from across the world can compare experiences, share tips and exchange messages of encouragement.'}, {'lung and heart problems': ' in particularly severe cases of scoliosis the ribcage can be pushed against the heart and lungs, causing breathing problems and making it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body. this can also increase the chances of lung infections, such as pneumonia, and lead to problems such as heart failure.'}, {'nerve compression': ' in some cases of scoliosis, particularly those affecting adults, the bones in the spine compress nearby nerves. in severe cases, this can cause problems such as:back and leg pain numbness or weakness in the legs'}, {'when to get professional help': ' rarely scoliosis can cause a condition called cauda equina syndrome to develop. cauda equina

inflammation. this helps to fight the infection and prevent it from spreading. however, an infection can spread to other parts of the body if the immune system is weak or an infection is severe. widespread inflammation can damage tissue and interfere with blood flow. when blood flow is interrupted, blood pressure can drop dangerously low. this stops oxygen from reaching the organs and

melanoma. radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. it is given at the hospital as a series of 10 to 15 minute daily sessions, with a rest period over the weekend. the side effects of radiotherapy include:tiredness nausea loss of appetite hair loss sore skin many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe, so let them know about

medications currently being used include:vemurafenib ipilimumab nivolumab however, not everyone is suitable for these drugs. your specialist will discuss an appropriate treatment with you, and many people are entered into clinical trials.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy\xa0involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to kill the cancer.\xa0it is normally used to treat melanoma that has spread to parts of the body and is mainly given to help relieve symptoms of advanced melanoma. several different chemotherapy drugs are used to treat melanoma and are occasionally given in combination. the drugs most commonly used for melanoma are dacarbazine and temozolomide. however, many different types of drugs can be used. your specialist can discuss with you which drugs are the most suitable. chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. dacarbazine is given through a drip and temozolomide is given in tablet form. chemotherapy sessions are usually given once every 3 to 4 weeks, with gaps between treatment intended to give your body and blood time to recover. the main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on the rest of the body. side effects include infection, nausea and vomiting, tiredness and sore mouth. many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.'}, {'electrochemotherapy': ' electrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for melanoma. it may be considered if:surgery isn’t suitable or hasn’t worked radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven’t worked the procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein).\xa0short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes. these electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour.\xa0the procedure\xa0is usually\xa0carried out using general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep) but some people may\xa0be able to have\xa0local anaesthetic\xa0(where you’re awake but the area is numbed). depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. the main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers. it usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated. your specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option. read the nice (2013) guidelines on electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin.'}, {'immunotherapy': ' immunotherapy uses drugs (often derived from substances that occur naturally in the body) that encourage your body’s immune system to work against the melanoma. two such treatments in regular use for melanoma are\xa0interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. both are given as an injection (into the blood, under the skin, or into lumps of melanoma). side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as chills, a high temperature, joint pain and fatigue.'}, {'vaccines': ' there is ongoing research\xa0into producing a vaccine for melanoma, either to treat advanced melanoma or to be used\xa0after surgery in patients who have a high risk of the melanoma coming back. vaccines are designed to focus the body’s immune system so it recognises the melanoma and can work against it. vaccines are usually given as an injection under the skin every few weeks, often over a period of months. as more research is needed into vaccines, they are only given as part of a clinical trial.'}, {'monoclonal antibodies': ' our immune systems make antibodies all the time, usually as a way of controlling infections. they are substances that recognise something which doesn’t belong in the body and help to destroy it. antibodies can be produced in the laboratory and can be made to recognise and lock onto specific targets, either in the cancer or in specific parts of the body. antibodies produced in the laboratory are usually called monoclonal antibodies.'}, {'signalling inhibitors': ' signalling inhibitors are drugs that work by disrupting the messages (signals) a cancer uses to co-ordinate its growth. there are hundreds of these signals, and it is difficult to know which ones need to be blocked. most of the signals have short, technical names. two that are of current interest in relation to melanoma are braf and mek. there are drugs available that can interfere with these signals, but most are currently only widely available as part of clinical trials. nice recommends a signalling inhibitor called vemurafenib as a possible treatment for melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed. read further information:cancer research uk: biological therapy for melanoma. cancer research uk: chemotherapy for melanoma.'}, {'clinical trials': ' all new treatment for cancer (and other diseases) is first given to patients in a clinical trial. a clinical trial or study is an extremely rigorous way of testing a drug on people. patients are monitored for any effects of the drug on the cancer, as well as side effects. many people with melanoma are offered entry into clinical trials, but some people are suspicious of the process. there are a few key things to know about clinical trials:overall, patients in clinical trials do better than those on routine treatment, even when receiving a drug that would be given routinely all clinical trials are highly regulated all new treatments will first become available through clinical trials even where a new drug fails to offer any benefits over existing treatment, the knowledge that we gain from the trial is valuable for future patients if you are asked to take part in a trial, you will

skin cancer (non-melanoma),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/skin-cancer-non-melanoma/,"[{'about non-melanoma skin cancer': ' skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. the term ‘non-melanoma’ distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as melanoma, which spreads faster in the body. the first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn’t heal after a few weeks. in most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly. speak to your gp if you have any skin abnormality that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks. although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure. read more about the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer'}, {'types of non-melanoma skin cancer': ' non-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop. the 2 most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are:basal cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers squamous cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers although not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses\xa0and bowen’s disease\xa0may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.'}, {'why does it happen?': ' non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (uv) light. uv light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps. in addition to uv light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as:a family history of the condition pale skin that burns easily a large number of moles or freckles read more about the causes of non-melanoma skin cancer'}, {'who is affected?': ' non-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. it affects slightly more men than women.'}, {'diagnosis': ' your gp can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. they may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer. your gp may refer you urgently, within 2 weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. basal cell skin cancers usually don’t need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks. the specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer. a biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope. read more about diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer'}, {'treating non-melanoma skin cancer': ' surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. this involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin. other treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (pdt). treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body. it is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. the risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2 to 5% of cases. treatment for\xa0non-melanoma skin cancer\xa0is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases. read more about treating non-melanoma skin cancer'}, {'complications': ' if you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. the chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe. if your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. you will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours.'}, {'prevention': ' non-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to uv light. you can help protect yourself from\xa0sunburn by using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day. sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. regularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment. read more about sunscreen and sun safety'}, {'symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer': ' the main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is the appearance of a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn’t heal. the lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour. non-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and\xa0shoulders.'}, {'basal cell carcinoma': ' basal cell carcinoma (bcc) usually\xa0appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or ‘waxy’ looking.\xa0it can also look like a red, scaly patch. the lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.'}, {'squamous cell carcinoma': ' squamous cell carcinoma (scc) appears as a firm pink lump\xa0and may have\xa0a flat, scaly and crusted surface. the lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.'}, {'when to\xa0seek medical advice': ' if you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks, speak to your gp. while it is unlikely to be cancer, it is best to be sure. read further information:cancer research uk: skin cancer symptoms macmillan:\xa0symptoms of skin cancer'}, {'causes of non-melanoma skin cancer': ' most skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (uv) light damaging the dna in skin cells. the main source of uv light is sunlight. sunlight contains 3 types of uv light:ultraviolet a (uva) ultraviolet b (uvb) ultraviolet c (uvc) uvc is filtered out by the earth’s atmosphere but uva and uvb damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. uvb is thought to be the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer. artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer. repeated sunburn, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, will make your skin more vulnerable to non-melanoma skin cancer.'}, {'family history': ' research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.'}, {'increased risk': ' certain factors are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including:pale skin that does not tan easily red or blonde hair blue eyes older age a large number of moles a large number of freckles an area of skin previously damaged by burning or

skin cancer.'}, {'diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer': ' a diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer will usually begin with a visit to your gp who will examine your skin and decide whether you need further assessment by a specialist. some gps take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment. in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of\xa0skin cancer\xa0and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected skin cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.'}, {'biopsy': ' if skin cancer is suspected, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or specialist plastic surgeon. the specialist should be able to confirm the diagnosis by carrying out a physical examination. however, they will probably also\xa0perform a biopsy – a surgical procedure where either a part or all of the tumour is removed and studied under a microscope. this is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area will be numbed so you won’t feel pain. this allows the dermatologist or plastic surgeon to determine what type of skin cancer you have and whether there is any chance the cancer could spread to other parts of your body. sometimes, skin cancer can be diagnosed and treated at the same time. in other words, the tumour can be removed and tested and you may not need further treatment because the cancer is unlikely to spread. it may be several weeks before you receive the results of a biopsy.'}, {'further tests': ' if you have basal cell carcinoma (bcc), then you usually won’t require further tests, as the cancer is unlikely to spread. however, in rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, further tests may be needed to make sure the cancer has not spread to another part of your body. these tests may include a physical examination of your lymph nodes (glands found throughout your body). if cancer has spread, it may cause your glands to swell. if the dermatologist or plastic surgeon thinks there is a high risk of the cancer spreading, it may be necessary to perform a biopsy on a lymph node. this is called a fine needle aspiration (fna). during fna, cells are removed using a needle and syringe so they can be examined. finding cancerous cells in a nearby lymph node would suggest the squamous cell carcinoma has started to spread to other parts of your body.'}, {'treating non-melanoma skin cancer': ' surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer, although it may depend on your individual circumstances. overall, treatment is successful for more than 90% of people with non-melanoma skin cancer. people with cancer should be cared for by a team of specialists that often includes a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, an oncologist (a radiotherapy and chemotherapy specialist), a pathologist and a specialist nurse. if you have non-melanoma skin cancer, you may see several (or all) of these professionals as part of your treatment. when deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:the type of cancer you have the stage of your cancer (how big it is and how far it has spread) your general health your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. for example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are. the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has produced healthcare guidelines about nhs skin cancer services. these outline nice’s main recommendations on how, over the coming years, people with skin cancer or melanoma should be treated. read further information:nice: improving outcomes for people with skin tumours including melanoma'}, {'surgical excision': ' surgical excision is an\xa0operation to\xa0cut out the cancer along with surrounding healthy tissue to ensure the cancer is completely removed. it may be done in combination with a skin graft, if\xa0it’s likely to leave significant scarring. a skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually from a part of your body where any scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. it is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. in many cases, this operation is enough to cure skin cancer.'}, {'curettage and electrocautery': ' curettage and electrocautery is a similar technique to surgical excision, but is only suitable for cases where the cancer is quite small. the surgeon will use a small, spoon-shaped blade to remove the cancer and an electric needle to remove the skin surrounding the wound. the procedure may need to be repeated two or three times to ensure the cancer is completely removed.'}, {'cryotherapy': ' cryotherapy uses cold treatment to destroy the cancer. it is sometimes used for non-melanoma skin cancers in their early stages. liquid nitrogen is used to freeze the cancer, and this causes the area to scab over. after about a month, the scab containing the cancer will fall off your skin. cryotherapy may leave a small white scar on your skin.'}, {'mohs micrographic surgery': ' mohs micrographic surgery (mms) is used to treat non-melanoma skin cancers when:it’s felt there is a high risk of the cancer spreading or returning the cancer is in an area where it would be important to remove as little skin as possible, such as the nose or eyes it involves removing the tumour bit by bit, as well as a small area of skin surrounding it. this minimises the removal of healthy tissue and reduces scarring. each time a piece of tissue is removed, it is checked for cancer. the procedure may need to be repeated 2 or 3 times to ensure\xa0the cancer is completely removed.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy involves using medicines to kill cancerous cells. in the case of non-melanoma skin cancer, chemotherapy is only recommended when the tumour is contained within the top layer of the skin. this type of chemotherapy involves applying a cream containing cancer-killing medicines to the affected area. as only the surface of the skin is affected, you will not experience the side effects associated with other forms of chemotherapy, such as vomiting or hair loss. however, your skin may feel sore for several weeks afterwards.'}, {'photodynamic therapy (pdt)': ' photodynamic therapy (pdt) is used to treat basal cell carcinoma,\xa0bowen’s disease and actinic keratoses. it involves using a cream which makes the skin highly sensitive to light. after the cream has been applied, a strong light source is shone onto the affected area of your skin, which kills the cancer. pdt may cause a burning sensation and around 2% of people who have this treatment will be left with some superficial scarring.'}, {'imiquimod cream': ' imiquimod cream is a treatment for basal cell carcinoma with a diameter of less than 2cm (0.8 inches). it’s also used to treat actinic keratoses. imiquimod encourages your immune system to attack the cancer in the skin. common side effects of imiquimod include redness, flaking or peeling skin\xa0and itchiness. less common and more serious side effects of imiquimod include blistering or ulceration of your skin. wash the cream off and contact your gp if your skin blisters or you develop ulcers after using it.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy involves using low doses of radiation to destroy the cancer. the level of radiation involved is perfectly safe. however, your skin may feel sore for a few weeks after radiotherapy. radiotherapy is sometimes used to treat basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas if:surgery would be unsuitable the cancer covers a large area the area is difficult to operate on radiotherapy is sometimes used after surgical excision to try to prevent the cancer coming back. this is called adjuvant radiotherapy.'}, {'electrochemotherapy': '

to other parts of the body (metastasis) testicular cancer is also staged numerically. the 4 main stages are:stage 1 – the cancer is contained within your testicle and epididymis (the tube at the back of the testicle) stage 2 – the cancer has spread from the testicles into the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) at the back of the abdomen stage 3 – the cancer has spread to the

more information about testicular cancer stages.'}, {'treating testicular cancer': ' chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the 3 main treatments for testicular cancer. your recommended treatment plan will depend on:the type of testicular cancer\xa0you have\xa0– whether it’s a\xa0seminoma or a non-seminoma the stage\xa0of your testicular cancer the first treatment option for all cases of testicular cancer, whatever the stage, is to surgically remove the affected testicle (an orchidectomy). for stage 1 seminomas, after the testicle has been removed, a single dose of chemotherapy\xa0may be given to help prevent the cancer returning. a short course of radiotherapy is also sometimes recommended. however, in many cases, the chance of recurrence is low and your doctors may recommend that you’re very carefully monitored over the next few years. further treatment is usually only needed for the small number of people who have a recurrence. for\xa0stage 1 non-seminomas, close follow-up (called surveillance) may also be recommended, or a short course of chemotherapy using a combination of different medications. for stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancers, 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy are given using a combination of different medications. further surgery is sometimes needed after chemotherapy to remove any affected lymph nodes or deposits in the lungs or, rarely, in the liver. some people with stage 2 seminomas may be suitable for less intense treatment with radiotherapy, sometimes with the addition of a simpler form of\xa0chemotherapy. in non-seminoma germ cell tumours, additional surgery may also be required after chemotherapy to remove tumours from other parts of the body, depending on the extent of the spread of the tumour. deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours. before discussing your treatment options with your\xa0specialist,\xa0you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask them. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.'}, {'orchidectomy': ' an orchidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a testicle. if you have testicular cancer, the whole of the affected testicle will need to be removed because only removing the tumour may lead to the cancer spreading. by removing the entire testicle, your chances of making a full recovery are greatly improved.\xa0your sex life and\xa0ability to father children won’t be affected. about\xa01 in 50 people will get a second new testicular cancer in their remaining testicle. in such circumstances, it’s\xa0sometimes possible to only remove the part of the testicle containing the tumour. you should ask your surgeon about this if you’re in this position. if testicular cancer is detected in its very early stages, an orchidectomy may be the only treatment you require. an orchidectomy isn’t carried out through the scrotum. it’s done by making an incision in your groin through which the testicle is\xa0removed with all of the tubes and blood vessels attached to the testicle that pass through the groin into the abdomen. the operation is carried out under general anaesthetic. you can have an artificial (prosthetic) testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles isn’t greatly affected. the artificial testicle is usually made of silicone (a soft type of plastic).\xa0it probably won’t be exactly like your old testicle or the one you still have. it may be slightly different in size or texture. after\xa0an orchidectomy, it’s often possible to be discharged quickly, although you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. if only 1 testicle is removed, there shouldn’t be any lasting side effects. if both testicles are removed (a bi-lateral orchidectomy), you’ll be infertile. however, removing both testicles at the same time is very rarely required, and only 1 in every 50 cases require the other testicle to be removed at a later date. you may be able to bank your sperm before having a bi-lateral orchidectomy to allow you to father children if you decide to.'}, {'lymph node and lung surgery': ' more advanced cases of testicular cancer may spread to your lymph nodes. lymph nodes are part of your body’s immune system, which helps protect against illness and infection. lymph node surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. the lymph nodes in your abdomen are the nodes most likely to need removing. in some cases, the nerves near the lymph nodes can become damaged, which means that rather than ejaculating semen out of your penis during sex or masturbation, the semen instead travels back into your bladder. this is known as retrograde ejaculation. if you have retrograde ejaculation, you’ll still experience the sensation of having an orgasm during ejaculation, but you won’t be able to father a child. there are a number of ways of treating retrograde ejaculation, including the use of medicines that strengthen the muscles around the neck of the bladder to prevent the flow of semen into the bladder. men and anyone with testicles who wants to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in\xa0artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (ivf). there are also a number of\xa0newer surgical techniques that carry a lower risk of retrograde ejaculation and infertility. some people with testicular cancer have deposits of cancer in their lungs and these may also need to be removed after chemotherapy if they haven’t disappeared or reduced sufficiently in size. this type of surgery is also carried out under general anaesthetic and doesn’t usually significantly affect breathing in the long-term.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy\xa0uses high-energy beams of radiation to help destroy cancer cells. sometimes, seminomas may require radiotherapy after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning. it may also be needed in advanced cases where someone is unable to tolerate the complex chemotherapies that are usually used to treat stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancer. if testicular cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may require radiotherapy after a course of chemotherapy. side effects of radiotherapy\xa0can include:reddening and soreness of the skin, which is similar to\xa0sunburn nausea diarrhoea fatigue these side effects are usually only temporary and should improve when your treatment is completed.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy\xa0uses powerful medicines to kill the malignant (cancerous) cells in your body or stop them multiplying. you may require chemotherapy if\xa0you have advanced testicular cancer or it’s spread within your body. it’s also used to help prevent the cancer returning. chemotherapy is commonly used to treat seminomas and non-seminoma tumours. chemotherapy medicines for testicular cancer are usually injected into a vein. in some cases, a special tube called a central line is used, which stays in a vein throughout your treatment so that you don’t have to keep having blood tests or needles placed in a new vein. sometimes, chemotherapy medicines can attack your body’s normal, healthy cells. this is why chemotherapy can have many different side effects. the most common\xa0include:vomiting hair loss nausea sore mouth and\xa0mouth ulcers loss of appetite fatigue breathlessness and lung damage infertility ringing in your ears (tinnitus) skin that bleeds or bruises easily low blood counts increased vulnerability to infection numbness and tingling (pins and

you have a low blood count, can be life-threatening, and it’s essential that you always call your cancer care team if you’re worried between chemotherapy treatments.'}, {'follow-up': ' even if your cancer has been completely cured, there’s a risk it will return.\xa0the risk of your cancer returning will depend on what stage it was at\xa0when you were diagnosed and what treatment you’ve had since. most recurrences of non-seminoma testicular cancer occur within 2 years of surgery or completion of chemotherapy. in seminomas, recurrences still occur until 3 years. recurrences after 3 years are rare, occurring in less than 5% of people. because of the risk of recurrence, you’ll need regular tests to check if the cancer has returned. these include:a physical examination blood tests\xa0to check for tumour markers a chest\xa0x-ray a\xa0computerised tomography (ct) scan follow-up and testing is usually recommended depending\xa0on the extent of the cancer and the treatment offered. this is usually more frequent in the first year or two but follow-up appointments may last for up to 5 years. in certain cases, it may be necessary to continue follow-up appointments for 10 years or longer. if the cancer returns following treatment for stage 1 testicular cancer, and it’s diagnosed at an early stage, it will usually be possible to cure it using chemotherapy and possibly also radiotherapy. some types of recurring testicular cancer have a cure rate of over 95%. recurrences that occur after previous combination chemotherapy can also be cured, but the chances of this will vary between individuals and you’ll need to ask your doctors to discuss this with you. cancer research uk has\xa0more information about follow-up for testicular cancer.'}, {'causes of testicular cancer': ' the causes of testicular cancer are not fully understood. however, several things that increase your\xa0risk of developing the condition.'}, {'undescended testicles': ' undescended testicles is the most significant risk factor. when male babies grow in the womb, their testicles develop inside their abdomen. the testicles then normally move down into the scrotum when the baby is born or during their first year of life. however, for some children, the testicles fail to descend. the medical name for\xa0undescended testicles is cryptorchidism. surgery is usually required to move the testicles down. if you have had surgery to move your testicles down into your scrotum, your risk of developing testicular cancer may be increased. of surgery is performed before the child is 13 years of age, their risk of later developing testicular cancer is approximately double that of the rest of the population. however, if the operation is carried out after the boy is 13 years of age, the risk of developing testicular cancer is 5 times greater\xa0than that of\xa0the rest of the population.'}, {'previous testicular cancer': ' men and anyone with testicles who has previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are 12 times more likely to develop testicular cancer in the other testicle. for this reason, it’s important to attend follow-up appointments if you have previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer.'}, {'age and race': ' unlike most other types of cancer, testicular cancer is more common in young and middle-aged men and anyone with testicles. men and anyone with testicles aged 30\xa0to 34 are most likely to be diagnosed with testicular cancer. testicular cancer is more common in white men and anyone with testicles than other ethnic groups. it’s also more common in northern and western europe compared with other parts of the world.'}, {'family history': ' having a close relative with a history of testicular cancer increases your risk of developing it. if your father had testicular cancer, you are 4 to 6 times more likely to develop\xa0it than\xa0a person with no family history of the condition. if your brother had testicular cancer, you are 8 to 10 times more likely to develop it (having an identical twin with testicular cancer means that you are 75 times more likely to develop it). the fact that testicular cancer appears to run in families has led researchers to speculate that there may be one or more genetic mutations (abnormal changes to the instructions that control cell activity) that make a person more likely to develop testicular cancer. mutations in 2 genes (known as the kitlg and spry4 genes) may\xa0increase the risk of a person developing testicular cancer.'}, {'endocrine disruptors': ' examples of endocrine disruptors include:some types of pesticide polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs), chemical compounds used as a coolant dibutyl phthalate, a chemical used to manufacture cosmetics, such as nail polish in most countries, including the uk, many endocrine disruptors, such as pcbs, have been withdrawn as a result of their link to health problems. however, there is a concern that exposure to endocrine disruptors may still occur due to contamination of the food chain. however, there is not yet enough evidence to prove a definite link between indirect exposure to low levels of endocrine disruptors and health problems. indirect exposure is the type of exposure that would occur if the food chain was contaminated.'}, {'infertility': ' men and anyone with testicles who are infertile\xa0are 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer. the reasons for this are not clear.'}, {'smoking': ' research has found that long-term smokers (people who have been smoking a pack of 20 cigarettes a day for 12 years or 10 cigarettes a day for 24 years) are twice as likely to develop testicular cancer\xa0than non-smokers.'}, {'hiv and aids': ' studies show that men and anyone with testicles with\xa0hiv or

to talk about your testicles and any changes to them that you’ve noticed. understanding more about what they do might help.'}, {'facts about testicles': ' testicles are small and oval-shaped. they hang below your penis in a sac called the scrotum. from puberty, your testicles produce a hormone called testosterone. this gives you a lower voice, hair on your face and body, and makes your muscles get bigger. you also need it for your sex drive and for getting an erection. the testicles make sperm from puberty (around 13\xa0to 14 years old) onwards. when sperm meets with a female egg during sex, this can cause pregnancy. the testicles make millions of sperm a day, but if sperm are not ejaculated they are reabsorbed back into your body. sperm wait in the epididymis next to the testicle until they are ejaculated. at ejaculation, they travel up through the spermatic cord and mix with fluid from the prostate to make semen. they go out of the body through the urethra (this is the same tube you pass urine (pee) through).'}, {'lymph nodes (glands)': ' lymph nodes are small and round, and connect to each other by tiny tubes that carry fluid called lymph. we have lymph nodes throughout our bodies. they are part of the lymphatic system, which protects us from infections. sometimes cancer cells from the testicle can spread to lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen (tummy). you’ll have a scan to check your lymph nodes. if you’re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer,\xa0read\xa0our general testicular cancer section.'}, {'having tests for testicular cancer': ' you may have tests done by your gp or at the hospital. they will help your doctors see whether you have testicular cancer.'}, {'visiting your gp': ' if you think you might have some of the symptoms of testicular cancer, you should go to your gp. they’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. if they think the symptoms could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more. if your doctor thinks there is a chance you might have cancer, they’ll examine your testicles. they might also arrange for you to have an ultrasound test. this uses sound waves to take a picture of the testicles.'}, {'at the hospital': ' if you need more tests you’ll be referred to a hospital. this could be a general hospital or a specialist cancer hospital. you’ll be seen by a specialist doctor (urologist), who will examine you and do the following tests:blood tests to check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers – some testicular cancers (but not all) produce high levels of these an ultrasound scan of the scrotum and testicles (if you haven’t already had one) – this can usually tell the difference between a cancer and a cyst (a harmless lump filled with fluid)'}, {'treating testicular cancer': ' treatment for testicular cancer can be very successful. surgery and chemotherapy are the 2 main types of treatment. often people have both treatments. to make sure you have the right treatment, your specialist needs to know what stage the cancer is. the stage of a cancer describes the tumour and whether it has spread outside the testicle. you may need some more tests to confirm what stage you are at. waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. but this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment. treatment for testicular cancer can be really successful. most young men with testicular cancer are cured, even if the cancer has spread. if you have any questions about your treatment, don’t be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse.'}, {'surgery': ' surgery\xa0to remove the testicle is one of the main treatments for testicular cancer. the operation is called an orchidectomy. it can be done as a day patient or during a short stay in hospital. you may feel shocked and scared at the thought of having this done. your doctor and nurse will tell you more about it so that you know what to expect. the surgeon makes a small cut (incision) through your lower abdomen (tummy) in the groin on the affected side. the testicle is pushed up from the scrotum and removed through the cut. during the operation the surgeon can put a false testicle into your scrotum so that you’ll look the same as before. your surgeon will explain this to you before the operation, or you can ask them about it. if this wasn’t done at the time of the operation, but now you think you would like this, talk to your doctor or nurse. it is a small operation to put this in later on.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy\xa0is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. you might be given chemotherapy:after the operation to remove your testicle, to reduce the chance of the cancer coming back to destroy cancer cells that have already spread outside the testicle if the cancer comes back occasionally before surgery, if the cancer has spread chemotherapy can affect your fertility. before your chemotherapy starts, your doctor will talk to you about storing some of your sperm. this is called sperm banking. we have more information about fertility issues. chemotherapy is given into a vein as injections or drips. you have your chemotherapy through one of the following:a fine tube called a cannula a line into a vein in the chest (called a central line) a line into the arm (picc line) that leads into a vein in the chest find out more about how chemotherapy is given. the amount of chemotherapy you have depends on the stage of the cancer. if the stage is low then you will have 1\xa0to 2 cycles (sessions) of chemotherapy. if the stage is higher, or if the cancer comes back during surveillance, you’ll usually have 3\xa0to 4 cycles of chemotherapy. the drugs most often used to treat testicular cancer are cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin. giving these drugs together is called bep. chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment. a cycle usually takes 3 weeks. if you have bep, you’ll usually spend 3 to 5 days of the first week having your chemotherapy as a day patient, or you might need to stay in hospital overnight. after this you’ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and again the following week. if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if it isn’t going away completely with bep, then different chemotherapy drugs can be given.'}, {'life after treatment for testicular cancer': ' being diagnosed with cancer can have a big impact on your life, even after you’ve finished treatment.'}, {'after treatment': ' once you finish your treatment, you’ll have regular follow-up appointments at the hospital. you’ll have blood tests for tumour markers and sometimes other scans or x-rays. if the tumour markers go up, this can be a sign that the cancer has come back. this means you need more treatment, which can still cure the cancer.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been received'}]"

complications of thyroid cancer'}, {'preventing thyroid cancer': ' from the available evidence, eating a\xa0healthy, balanced diet is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer. a low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and whole grains.'}, {'symptoms of thyroid cancer': ' in its early stages, thyroid cancer tends to cause no or very few symptoms. the main symptom of thyroid cancer is a lump or swelling at the front of the neck\xa0just below your adam’s apple, which is usually painless. women also have adam’s apples, but they’re\xa0much smaller and less prominent\xa0than a man’s. the lymph nodes in your neck can also be affected and become swollen. lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the lymphatic system, which helps fight infection. other symptoms of thyroid cancer only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include:unexplained hoarseness that doesn’t get better after a few weeks a\xa0sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn’t get better pain in your neck'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' you should always speak to your gp if you develop a swelling or lump\xa0at the front of your neck. although it’s unlikely to be thyroid cancer, it’s important that\xa0it is\xa0investigated. about 1 in 20 swellings or lumps in the neck are caused by thyroid cancer. most cases are caused by non-cancerous swellings called\xa0goitres.'}, {'goitres': ' a\xa0goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland. non-cancerous goitres\xa0are usually caused by other less serious problems with your thyroid gland, such as:too much triiodothyronine (t3) and thyroxine (t4) hormones\xa0– this is known as having an overactive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism not enough t3 and t4 hormones\xa0– this is known as having an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism'}, {'thyroid cancer support': ' the butterfly thyroid cancer trust provides information, advice and support for people with thyroid cancer. as well as the website, they also have a helpline number that can be contacted on\xa001207 545469, monday to friday, 10am to 4pm.'}, {'causes of thyroid cancer': ' in most cases, the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. however, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing the condition, including having another thyroid condition and being exposed to\xa0radiation.'}, {'what is cancer?': ' cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means cells grow and\xa0reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. the lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) located throughout the body. lymph nodes\xa0produce many of the cells needed by your immune system (the body’s natural defence system against infection and illness). once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it’s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs. the most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas, which are known as differentiated thyroid cancers (dtcs). they spread much more slowly than other types of cancer. when dtcs are diagnosed, they’re usually limited to the thyroid gland itself or nearby lymph nodes. the rarer types of thyroid cancer are more aggressive and spread faster. by the time medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed, it may have spread to the lymph nodes. in advanced cases, it may have also spread to the bones and lungs. anaplastic thyroid cancer often spreads to the windpipe and, in some cases, the lungs.'}, {'risk factors for thyroid cancer': ' the main risk factors for developing thyroid cancer are:having a thyroid condition having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer) having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) acromegaly (a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone) having previous benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions weight and height radiation exposure'}, {'other risk factors': ''}, {'diagnosing thyroid cancer': ' for many people, the first stage of diagnosing thyroid cancer is a consultation with a gp. your gp will examine your neck and ask about any associated symptoms you may be experiencing, such as unexplained hoarseness.'}, {'thyroid function test': ' a blood test known as a thyroid function test is used to check whether the swelling in your neck is caused by other problems with your thyroid gland. it will rule out conditions such as an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), which are the most common thyroid problems. a thyroid function test measures the amount of certain types of hormones in your blood. further tests will be needed if the thyroid function test reveals your thyroid gland is working normally.'}, {'fine-needle aspiration cytology': ' fine-needle aspiration cytology (fnac)\xa0is the next stage in diagnosing thyroid cancer. it’s an outpatient procedure, which means you won’t have to spend the night in hospital. a\xa0small needle\xa0is inserted into the lump in your neck to allow a tiny sample of cells to be removed. the sample\xa0is then\xa0studied under a microscope. this test\xa0can usually reveal whether cancerous cells are present in your thyroid gland and, if they are, what type of thyroid cancer you have.'}, {'further testing': ' further testing may be recommended if the fnac results are inconclusive or if further information is needed to make your treatment more effective. these tests may include:repeat fnac combined with an ultrasound scan other types of scan, such as a\xa0computerised tomography (ct) scan or\xa0magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan in most cases, surgery will be recommended to remove the part of the thyroid gland that contains the lump or swelling\xa0when it hasn’t been possible to rule out thyroid cancer.'}, {'treating thyroid cancer': ' if you’re diagnosed with thyroid cancer, you’ll be assigned a care team, who will devise a treatment plan for you. your recommended\xa0treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether your care team thinks that a complete cure is realistically achievable.'}, {'cancer treatment team': ' all nhs hospitals have multidisciplinary teams (mdts)\xa0that treat thyroid cancer. an mdt is made up of a number of different specialists, and may include:a surgeon an endocrinologist (a specialist in treating hormonal conditions) an oncologist (a cancer treatment specialist) a pathologist (a specialist in diseased tissue) a radiotherapist or clinical oncologist (a specialist in non-surgical methods of treating cancer, such as\xa0chemotherapy and radiotherapy) a specialist cancer nurse, who will usually be your\xa0first point of contact with the rest of the team deciding on the best course of treatment can be difficult. your cancer team will make recommendations after reviewing your case, but the final decision will be yours. before you go to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of\xa0questions to ask\xa0the specialist. for example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.'}, {'your treatment plan': ' your recommended treatment will depend on a number of things, including:the type of thyroid cancer you have the grade of your cancer whether your care team thinks\xa0a complete cure is realistically achievable most differentiated thyroid cancers\xa0– papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas\xa0– and some medullary thyroid carcinomas have a good prospect of achieving a cure. differentiated thyroid cancers\xa0are treated using a combination of:surgery to remove your thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) a type of radiotherapy called\xa0radioactive iodine treatment, which is\xa0designed to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the thyroid cancer returning medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than differentiated thyroid cancers, so it may be necessary to remove\xa0your thyroid gland and any nearby lymph nodes. radiotherapy iodine treatment is not effective\xa0at treating this type of thyroid cancer. stage 4 medullary thyroid carcinomas aren’t usually curable, but it should be possible to slow their progression and control any associated symptoms. in most cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a cure isn’t usually achievable. this is because it’s usually spread to other parts of the\xa0body by the time it’s been diagnosed. radiotherapy\xa0and\xa0chemotherapy can be used to slow the progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and help control any symptoms. some cases of differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma may benefit from a new type of treatment known as targeted therapies. this is where medication is used to directly target the cancerous cells. however, these\xa0types of treatments are currently undergoing\xa0clinical trials and aren’t offered routinely on the nhs.'}, {'thyroidectomy': ' in almost all cases of thyroid cancer it’s necessary to either remove some of your thyroid gland in a procedure called a hemithyroidectomy, or all of your thyroid gland\xa0(total thyroidectomy). this decision\xa0will be influenced by:the type of thyroid cancer you have the size of the tumour whether or not the cancer has spread beyond your thyroid gland your surgeon should discuss with you the type of surgery required and why so\xa0you can make an informed decision. a thyroidectomy\xa0is carried out under a general anaesthetic and usually takes around 2\xa0hours. the operation will leave a small scar on your neck, which\xa0shouldn’t be very noticeable. in a small number of cases, it may cause permanent hoarseness. most people are well enough to leave hospital 3\xa0to 5\xa0days after having thyroid surgery. however, you’ll need to rest at home for 2\xa0to 3\xa0weeks and avoid any activities that could put a strain on your neck, such as heavy lifting. a member of your care team will be able to advise you about when you’ll be fit enough to resume normal activities and return to work.'}, {'replacement hormone therapy': ' if some or all of your thyroid gland is removed, it will no longer be able to produce the hormones that regulate your metabolic system. this means you’ll experience symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), such as fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight gain and dry skin. to compensate, you’ll need to take replacement hormone tablets for the rest of your life. if your surgery is to be followed by radioactive iodine treatment, it’s likely you’ll be given a hormone tablet called triiodothyronine. after radioactive iodine treatment is completed, you’ll be prescribed an alternative hormone tablet called thyroxine, which most people only need to take once a day. you’ll need to have regular blood tests to check you’re receiving the right amount of hormones and to determine whether your dose needs to be adjusted. it may take some time to achieve the optimum dose. until this time, you may experience symptoms of tiredness or weight gain if your hormone levels are too low. alternatively, if your hormone levels are too high, you may experience symptoms such as weight loss, hyperactivity or diarrhoea. you shouldn’t experience any more side effects once the\xa0right dose has been achieved.'}, {'calcium levels': ' occasionally, the parathyroid glands can be affected during surgery. the parathyroid glands are located close to the thyroid gland and help regulate the levels of calcium in your blood. if your parathyroid glands are affected, your calcium levels may decrease, which can cause a tingling sensation in your hands, fingers, lips and around your nose. these symptoms should be reported to your mdt or gp as you may need to take calcium supplements. most people only need to take a short course of calcium tablets\xa0as the parathyroid glands will soon start to function normally again.'}, {'radioactive iodine treatment': ' after having thyroid surgery, a course of radioactive iodine treatment may be recommended. this will\xa0help destroy any remaining cancer cells in your body and prevent the cancer returning. if you’re taking thyroid hormone replacement tablets, you’ll need to stop taking them for 2 to 4 weeks before having radioactive iodine treatment. this is because they can interfere with the effectiveness of the iodine treatment. if withdrawing your hormone replacement treatment is problematic, you may be given a medicine called recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhtsh). this is given as an injection on 2 consecutive days. your mdt will be able to advise you about whether or not rhtsh is suitable for you.'}, {'external radiotherapy': ' external radiotherapy, where radioactive waves are targeted at affected parts of the body, is usually only used to treat advanced or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. the length of time you’ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on the particular type of thyroid cancer you have and its progression. side effects of radiotherapy include:nausea vomiting tiredness pain when swallowing dry mouth these side effects should pass 2 to 3 weeks after your course of radiotherapy has finished.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy\xa0is usually only used to treat anaplastic thyroid carcinomas that have spread to other parts of your body. it\xa0involves taking powerful medicines that kill cancerous cells. it’s rarely successful\xa0in curing anaplastic cancer, but can slow its progression and help relieve symptoms. possible side effects of chemotherapy include:nausea vomiting tiredness loss of appetite hair loss mouth ulcers if you’re receiving chemotherapy, you’ll also be more vulnerable to infection. see your gp if you suddenly feel ill or your temperature rises above 38c (100.4f).'}, {'targeted therapies': ' a number of targeted therapies are being tested in\xa0clinical trials to treat advanced cases of:medullary thyroid cancers differentiated thyroid cancers that don’t respond to radioactive iodine anaplastic thyroid carcinomas in targeted therapies, medication specifically targets the biological functions that cancers need to grow and spread. as research is ongoing, some medications used in this type of treatment are unlicensed. in exceptional circumstances, your specialist may suggest using an unlicensed medication. they’ll do this if:they think it’s likely to be effective there are no better alternatives the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks if your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication, they’ll tell you that it’s unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you. the decision about whether to fund treatment with medications used in targeted therapies is often made by individual\xa0clinical commissioning groups (ccgs).'}, {'complications of thyroid cancer': ' cancerous cells can return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed. it’s\xa0estimated that 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer will experience a return of cancerous cells in their neck. an estimated 10% to 15% of people will\xa0see a return of cancerous cells in other parts of their body, such as their bones. because of\xa0the risk of cancer cells returning, you’ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that do return can be treated quickly.'}, {'thyroglobulin testing': ' thyroglobulin testing is a special type of blood test that’s used to monitor some types of thyroid cancer and to check for the return of cancerous cells. thyroglobulin is a protein released by a healthy thyroid gland, but it can also be released by cancerous cells. if you’ve had your thyroid gland removed, there should be no thyroglobulin present in your blood, unless cancerous cells have returned. regularly testing your blood for thyroglobulin can be an effective way of checking whether or not any cancerous cells have returned. for the first few years after having surgery you’ll probably need to have thyroglobulin testing every 6 months. after this period, you’ll need to be tested once a year.'}, {'ultrasound scan': ' an ultrasound scanner uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside of the body. an\xa0ultrasound scan\xa0can detect changes inside your neck that could indicate the recurrence of cancer.'}, {'radioactive iodine scan': ' after\xa0surgery to remove part or all of your thyroid gland, you may be asked to attend a radioactive iodine scanning test. you swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine before undergoing a scan. the radioactive iodine will highlight any cancerous thyroid cells in the body. before the scan, you’ll need to go on a low-iodine diet and stop taking your thyroid hormone medication. as\xa0only a small\xa0dose of radioactive iodine\xa0is used, it’s not necessary to\xa0keep your distance from others. however, if you think you may be pregnant or you’re breastfeeding, let the doctors know before your test. a radioactive iodine scan will\xa0usually be carried out\xa06 to 8 months after surgery.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been received'}]"

(radiologist) a clinical nurse specialist your doctor will examine you and arrange for more detailed tests, which may include an ultrasound, a fine needle aspiration (fna) or a biopsy. an fna involves having a very small needle placed into your thyroid gland to remove a few cells for the pathologist to look at under the microscope. a biopsy involves removing a small piece of the thyroid to be analysed. you might have a general anaesthetic and so will be asleep when it is done. you may only need a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area. there is more information about having an anaesthetic in the surgery section. if the biopsy shows that it is thyroid cancer you will have some other tests to check the size of the tumour and whether it has spread. macmillan cancer support has information on these tests. these tests may include:a chest x-ray to check your lungs a ct, mri or pet\xa0scan a radioisotope scan you won’t necessarily need all of these tests. it will depend on the results of

decay depends on how advanced it is. for early stage tooth decay – your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. they may apply a fluoride gel, varnish or paste\xa0to the area. fluoride\xa0helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay. your dentist may discuss\xa0a filling or crown with you. this involves removing the dental decay, offering\xa0local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and filling the hole. if tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) – this may be removed in a process known as\xa0root canal treatment. if the tooth is so badly damaged that it can’t be restored – it may need to be removed. your

film over the teeth called dental plaque. when you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates – particularly sugary foods and drinks – the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time. if the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities. once cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). as the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up. without treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). at this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your

facial pain, described as sharp, shooting or like an electric shock. it usually occurs in sudden short attacks lasting from a few seconds to about two minutes, which stop just as abruptly. in the vast majority of cases it affects part or all of one side of the face,\xa0with the pain most commonly felt in the lower part of the face. very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time. people with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day. it’s possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks. typically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever. living with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression. read more about the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' you should see your gp if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as\xa0paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes. your gp will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. however, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult, and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed. read more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia'}, {'what causes trigeminal neuralgia?': ' in the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. this is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain. this compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. in rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such as\xa0multiple sclerosis (ms) or a tumour. read more about the causes of trigeminal neuralgia'}, {'who is affected': ' it’s not clear exactly how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but the condition is thought to be rare. some studies have suggested that around 27 in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the uk each year, although this figure is probably too high as the condition tends to be over-diagnosed by doctors. other estimates have suggested that there are about 6,500 new cases diagnosed each year in the uk. the condition affects women more often than men and is rare in people under the age of 40, although it can occur in younger people. most cases are first seen in people between the ages of 50 and 60.'}, {'how trigeminal neuralgia is treated': ' trigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition, and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. however, most cases can be controlled to at least some degree with treatment. the first treatment offered will usually be with an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat\xa0epilepsy) called carbamazepine. to be effective, this medication needs to be taken several times a day, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so that high enough levels of the medication can build up in your bloodstream. unless your pain starts to diminish or disappears altogether, the medication is usually continued for as long as is necessary, sometimes for many years. if you are entering a period of remission and your pain goes away, stopping the medication should always be done slowly over days or weeks, unless you are advised otherwise by a doctor. carbamazepine was not originally designed to treat pain, but it can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages. if this medication is ineffective, unsuitable or causes too many side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medications or surgical procedures that may help. there are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia – usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals – but these are generally only effective for a few years. alternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open up your skull and move away any blood vessels compressing the trigeminal nerve. research suggests this operation offers the best results in terms of long-term pain relief, but it is a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as\xa0hearing loss,\xa0facial numbness or, very rarely, a stroke. read more about treating trigeminal neuralgia'}, {'symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia': ' the main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes. the pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. the attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees. trigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. in rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. the pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye. you may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly. after the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. there may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks. you may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. it is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as “remission”). however, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission.'}, {'symptom triggers': ' attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as:talking smiling chewing brushing your teeth washing your face a light touch shaving or putting on make-up swallowing kissing a cool breeze or air conditioning head movements vibrations, such as walking or a car journey however, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever.'}, {'further problems': ' living with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected. you may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. however, it’s important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse. the emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such as depression. during periods of extreme pain, some people may even consider suicide. even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning.'}, {'when to see your gp': ' you should see your gp if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as paracetamol\xa0and ibuprofen\xa0do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes. your gp will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose, so it’s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible. read more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia'}, {'causes of trigeminal neuralgia': ' although the exact cause is not known, trigeminal neuralgia is often thought to be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve or an underlying condition affecting this nerve.'}, {'the trigeminal nerve': ' the trigeminal nerve (also called the fifth cranial nerve) is the largest nerve inside the skull. you have two trigeminal nerves, one in each side of your face. small branches from different parts of the face join into three major nerve branches. these are:the upper branch (ophthalmic) – which carries sensory information from the skin above the eye, forehead and front of the head the middle branch (maxillary) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the cheek, side of the nose, upper jaw, teeth and gums the lower branch (mandibular) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the lower jaw, teeth and gums these branches enter the skull through three different routes and then join together in what is called the gasserian ganglion, before connecting to the brainstem in the part of the skull called the posterior fossa. trigeminal neuralgia can involve one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. the maxillary and mandibular branches are affected most often, and the ophthalmic branch is the least commonly affected.'}, {'pressure on the trigeminal nerve': ' evidence suggests that in up to 95% of cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is pressure on the trigeminal nerve close to where it enters the brain stem (the lowest part of the brain that merges with the spinal cord), past the gasserian ganglion. in most cases, this pressure seems to be caused by an artery or vein compressing the trigeminal nerve, although it’s not known why this happens. it’s also not clear exactly why this pressure can cause painful attacks, as not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve will experience pain. it may be that, in some people, the pressure on the nerve wears away its protective outer layer called the myelin sheath, which may cause uncontrollable pain signals to travel along the nerve. however, this does not fully explain why periods of remission (periods without symptoms) can occur and why pain relief is immediate after a successful operation to move the blood vessels away from the nerve.'}, {'other underlying causes': ' other reasons why the trigeminal nerve can become compressed or damaged include:a tumour (a growth or lump) a cyst (fluid-filled sac) arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins) multiple sclerosis (ms) – a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)'}, {'diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia': ' as the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia is often felt in the jaw, teeth or gums, it is common for people to visit their dentist initially, rather than their gp. if you visit your dentist, they will ask you questions about your symptoms and investigate your facial pain using a dental x-ray and other means to look for other more common causes, such as a dental infection or cracked tooth. if the dentist cannot find a cause, it is important not to undergo unnecessary treatment such as a root canal filling or an extraction, even though you may be convinced that it is a tooth problem. if your dentist can’t find anything wrong, do not try to persuade them to remove a particular tooth, as this will not solve the problem. often, the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is made by a dentist, but if you have already seen your dentist and they have not been able to find an obvious cause of your pain, visit your gp.'}, {'seeing your gp': ' there is no specific test for trigeminal neuralgia, so a diagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and your description of the pain. if you have experienced facial pain, your gp will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as how often they occur, how long the pain attacks last and which areas of your face are affected. the more details about your pain you can provide, the better. your gp will consider other possible causes of your pain and may also examine your head and jaw to identify which parts are painful.'}, {'mri scans': ' if your gp is not sure about your diagnosis, or if you have unusual symptoms, they may refer you for a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan\xa0of your head. an mri scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your head. it can help identify potential causes of your facial pain, such as\xa0sinusitis (inflammation of the lining of the sinuses), tumours on one of the facial nerves, or nerve damage caused by ms. an mri can also sometimes detect whether a blood vessel in your head is compressing one of the trigeminal nerves, which is one of the main causes of trigeminal neuralgia. however, highly sophisticated mri scans may be needed to show this accurately, although this may not necessarily be helpful, because not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve has trigeminal neuralgia.'}, {'treating trigeminal neuralgia': ' there are a number of treatments available that can offer some relief from the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia. identifying triggers and avoiding them can also help. most people with trigeminal neuralgia will be prescribed medication to help control their pain, although surgery may be considered for the longer term in those cases where medication is ineffective or causes too many side effects.'}, {'avoid triggers': ' the painful attacks associated with trigeminal neuralgia can sometimes be triggered or made worse by a number of different things. therefore, in addition to your medical treatment, it may help to try to avoid these triggers, if possible. for example, if your pain is triggered by wind or even a draught in a room, it may help to avoid sitting near open windows or the source of air conditioning, and wearing a scarf wrapped around your face in windy weather. a transparent dome-shaped umbrella can also protect your face from the weather. hot, spicy or cold food or drink may also trigger your pain, so avoiding these can help. using a straw to drink warm or cold drinks may also help prevent the liquid coming into contact with the painful areas of your mouth. it is important to eat nourishing meals, however, so if you are having difficulty chewing, consider eating mushy foods or liquidising your meals. certain foods seem to trigger attacks in some people, so you may want to consider avoiding things such as caffeine, citrus fruits and bananas.'}, {'medication': ' as normal painkillers such as\xa0paracetamol are not effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia, you will normally be prescribed an alternative medication, such as an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat\xa0epilepsy) to help control your pain. these medications were not originally designed to treat pain, but they can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain. they need to be taken regularly, not just when the pain attacks occur, but can be stopped when the episodes of pain cease and you are in remission.\xa0 unless otherwise instructed by your gp or specialist, it is important to build up the dosage slowly and reduce it again gradually over a few weeks. taking too much too soon and stopping the medication too quickly can cause serious problems. initially, your gp will probably prescribe a type of anticonvulsant called carbamazepine, although a number of alternatives are available if this is ineffective or unsuitable.'}, {'surgery and procedures': ' if medication does not adequately control your symptoms or is causing persistently troublesome side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss the different surgical and non-surgical options available to relieve your pain. there a number of procedures that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, so you will need to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment with your specialist before making a decision. it is wise to be as informed as possible and to make the choice that it right for you as an individual. there is no guarantee that one or any of these procedures will work for you but, once you have had a successful procedure, you won’t need to take your pain medications unless the pain returns. if one procedure does not work, you can always try another or remain on your medication temporarily or permanently. some of the procedures that can be used to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia are outlined below.'}, {'more information and support': ' living with a long-term and painful condition such as trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult. you may find it useful to contact local or national support groups, such as the trigeminal neuralgia association uk, for more information and advice about living with the condition, and to get in touch with other people who have the condition to talk to them about their experiences. research has shown that groups that have support from health care professionals provide high-quality help, which can significantly improve your ability to manage this rare condition. learning from others how to cope can help remove the fear of more pain and reduce the risk of depression. however, you need to be wary of potentially unreliable information you may find elsewhere, especially if offering “cures” for the condition. there is a great deal of misinformation on the internet, so do your research only on reliable websites, not on open forums or on social media. there are a number of research projects running both in the uk and abroad to determine the cause of this condition and to find new treatments, including new medications, so there is always hope on the horizon.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been received'}]"

hospital admission during treatment is not necessary.'}, {'pulmonary tb': ' if you’re diagnosed with active pulmonary tb (tb that affects your lungs and causes symptoms), you will be given a 6-month course of a combination of antibiotics. the usual course of treatment is:2 antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for 6 months 2 additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first 2 months it may be several weeks or months before you start to feel better. the exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your tb. after taking the medicine for 2 weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better. however, it is\xa0important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics. taking medication for 6 months is the most effective method of ensuring the tb bacteria are killed. if you stop taking your antibiotics before you complete the course, or\xa0you skip a dose, the tb infection may become resistant to the antibiotics. this is potentially serious, as it can be difficult to treat and will require a longer course of treatment. if you find it difficult to take your medication every day, your treatment team can work with you to find a solution. this may include having regular contact with your treatment team at home, the treatment clinic, or somewhere else that is more convenient. if\xa0treatment is completed correctly, you should not need any further checks by a tb specialist afterwards. however, you may be given advice about spotting signs that the illness has returned, although this is rare. in\xa0rare cases tb can be fatal, even with treatment. death can occur if the lungs become too damaged to work properly.'}, {'extrapulmonary tb': ' extrapulmonary tb (tb that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary tb. however, you may need to take them for 12 months. if you have tb in areas such as your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed a\xa0corticosteroid such as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. this will help to reduce any swelling in the affected areas. as with pulmonary tb, it’s important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course.'}, {'latent tb': ' latent tb is when you have been infected with the tb bacteria, but do not have any symptoms of active disease. treatment for latent tb is usually recommended for anyone aged 65 or under. however, the antibiotics used to treat tb can cause liver damage in older adults, so treatment for people with latent tb aged 35 to 65 isn’t recommended if this is a concern. latent tb is also not always treated if it’s thought to be drug-resistant. if this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection does not become active. in some cases, testing and treatment for latent tb may be recommended for people who require treatment that will weaken their immune system, such as long-term corticosteroids, chemotherapy or tnf inhibitors. this is because there is a risk of the infection becoming active. treatment for latent tb generally involves either taking a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for 3 months, or isoniazid on its own for 6 months.'}, {'preventing the

(sugar) level to become too high. the hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood. there are two main types of diabetes:type 1 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce any insulin type 2 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin this topic is about type 1 diabetes. read more about type 2 diabetes another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth. it’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. you should therefore visit your gp if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and losing weight unexpectedly (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).'}, {'type 1 diabetes': ' type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. around 10% of all diabetes is type 1. in type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) progressively reduces the amount of insulin (the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels) it produces until it stops producing any at all. if the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body’s organs.'}, {'diabetes symptoms': ' the symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose is high but isn’t used by your muscles as fuel for energy. when blood glucose is high, glucose is lost in your urine and you may become dehydrated. typical symptoms include:feeling very thirsty passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired all the time weight loss and loss of muscle bulk persistent infections such as thrush the symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few hours or days). in adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few days or weeks). read more about the symptoms of type 1 diabetes'}, {'causes of type 1 diabetes': ' type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them. without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. this can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. this is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severely dehydrated. this results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. this is called type 1 diabetes. read more about the causes of type 1 diabetes'}, {'treating type 1 diabetes': ' it’s important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible.\xa0if left untreated, type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. it’s essential that treatment is started early. diabetes can’t be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life. if you’re diagnosed with diabetes, you’ll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring. as your body can’t produce insulin, you’ll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. you’ll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do. insulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. you’ll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations. insulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid)\xa0acting insulin (pump therapy). this is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that’s inserted under the skin with a needle. there are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they’re only suitable for a small number of patients. they are:islet cell transplantation – where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1

food intake and exercise. your diabetes team will work with you to manage your insulin correctly. read more about the complications of type 1 diabetes'}, {'living with diabetes': ' if you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to look after your health very carefully. caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications. for example, eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly will lower your blood glucose level. stopping smoking (if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. your healthcare team will discuss this with you, and you can see your own results through my diabetes my way. it’s important that you learn the skills to self manage your diabetes and there are people to help and support you to do this. if you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it’s not treated. everyone with diabetes aged 12 or

(or a “hypo”). in most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink alcohol\xa0on an empty stomach. symptoms of a “hypo” include:feeling shaky and irritable sweating tingling lips feeling weak feeling confused hunger nausea (feeling sick) a hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary. if it isn’t brought under control, a hypo can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness. in this case, an emergency injection of a hormone called glucagon will be needed. glucagon increases the glucose in your blood.\xa0your diabetes team will advise you in more detail about avoiding, recognising and treating a hypo.'}, {'hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose)': ' as diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. this happens because there’s insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy. if your blood glucose levels become too high, you may experience hyperglycaemia. the symptoms of hyperglycaemia are similar to the main symptoms of diabetes, but they may come on suddenly and be more severe. they include:extreme thirst a dry mouth blurred vision drowsiness a need to pass urine frequently left untreated or if you already have an infection, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. this is a life-threatening\xa0condition, where the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. this leads to a build-up of acids in your blood, which can cause vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness and even death. your healthcare

of your blood and into your cells, where it’s converted to energy. however, if you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas is unable to produce any insulin (see below). this means that glucose can’t be moved out of your bloodstream and into your cells.'}, {'autoimmune condition': ' type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. your immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin. it’s not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection. type 1 diabetes is often inherited (runs in families), so the autoimmune reaction may also be genetic. if you have a close relative – such as a parent, brother or sister – with type 1 diabetes, you have about a 6% chance of also developing the condition. the risk for people who don’t have a

urine doesn’t usually contain glucose, but if you have diabetes, some glucose can overflow through the kidneys and into the urine. your urine may also be tested for ketones (chemicals) that indicate type 1 diabetes. the gp may do a finger prick blood test for glucose and ketones. a sample will be sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. these results will be discussed with the specialist diabetes service if there is concern you have type 1 diabetes.'}, {'glycated haemoglobin (hba1c)': ' the glycated haemoglobin (hba1c) test is another blood test that can be used to diagnose diabetes.nd to monitor our long-term diabetes control. in people who’ve already been diagnosed with diabetes, the hba1c test is often used to show how well their diabetes is being controlled. the hba1c test gives your average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months. the results can indicate whether the measures you’re taking to control your diabetes are working. if you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes, it’s recommended that you have your hba1c measured at least twice a year. however, you may need to have your hba1c measured more frequently if:you’ve recently been diagnosed with diabetes your blood glucose remains too high your treatment plan has been changed you’re planning a pregnancy unlike other tests, the hba1c test can be carried out at any time of day and doesn’t require any special preparation, such as fasting. however, it’s less reliable in certain situations, such as during pregnancy. the advantages associated with the hba1c test make it the preferred method of assessing how well blood glucose levels are being controlled in a person with diabetes. read about treating type 1 diabetes'}, {'treating type 1 diabetes': ''}, {'monitoring blood glucose': ' an important part of your treatment is to make sure that your blood glucose level is as normal and stable as possible. you’ll be able to manage this using insulin treatment and by eating a healthy, balanced diet, but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they’re not too high or too low. exercise, illness, stress, drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, changes to your hormone levels during your monthly period can all affect your blood glucose levels. in most cases, you’ll need to check your blood glucose levels during the day, both at home and at work or school, using a simple finger prick blood test. you may need to do this up to four or more times a day, depending on the type of insulin treatment you’re taking. there are different methods of checking your blood glucose that doesn’t involve pricking your finger. discuss your options with your diabetes care team. the normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals. mmol/l means millimoles per litre, and it’s a way of defining the concentration of glucose in your blood. there is another method to check glucose levels without pricking your finger. this is called a flash glucose monitor\xa0(freestyle libre). the diabetes uk website has more information on testing your glucose levels.'}, {'having your blood glucose levels checked': ' you’ll be measuring your blood glucose yourself every day, to check your levels. your gp or diabetes care team will also carry out a different blood test every two to six months, called the hba1c test. this gives a clearer idea of how well your treatment plan is working, by measuring how stable your glucose levels have been over the past 6-12 weeks. it measures the amount of haemoglobin, which is the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it. a high hba1c level may indicate that your blood glucose level is consistently high and that your diabetes treatment plan needs to be altered. the ideal hba1c target for people with diabetes is below 53 mmol/mol.'}, {'treating hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)': ' hypoglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose level becomes very low. it’s likely that you’ll develop hypoglycaemia from time to time. mild hypoglycaemia (or a “hypo”) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, and can be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary, such as:200ml pure fruit juice 5 to 7 dextrose tablets 4 to 5 glucotabs 60ml glucojuice 5 jelly babies you may also be able to take pure glucose, in the form of a tablet or fluid, if you need to control the symptoms of a hypo quickly. if you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you can become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. if this occurs, you’ll need assistance from another person who may be able to give you a glucose gel rubbed into your cheeks or an injection of glucagon into your muscle. glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels. your diabetes care team may show several of your family members and close friends how to inject glucagon or give you glucose gel, should you need it. once you begin to come round, you’ll need to eat something sugary when you’re alert enough to do so. if you lose consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia, there’s a risk that it could happen again within a few hours. you’ll need to rest afterwards and have someone with you to ensure that you eat some food to replace the glucose stores in your body. if the glucagon injection into your muscle doesn’t work, and you’re still drowsy or unconscious 10 minutes after the injection, you’ll need urgent medical attention. you’ll need to have an injection of dextrose straight into a vein, which must be given by a trained healthcare professional. if you have type 1 diabetes, it’s recommended that you carry identification with you so that people are aware of the problem if you become hypoglycaemic. if significant hypoglycaemia is a regular problem or you have lost your awareness of hypoglycaemia your health care team may consider using a continuous glucose monitor (cgm).'}, {'islet cell transplantation': ' some people with type 1 diabetes may benefit from a fairly new procedure known as islet cell transplantation. it involves implanting healthy islet cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes. in 2008, a government-funded islet cell transplant programme was introduced, and the procedure is now available through the nhs for people who satisfy certain criteria (see below). you may be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you’ve had:two or more severe hypos within the last two years and you have a poor awareness of hypoglycaemia a working kidney transplant, severe hypos and poor hypoglycaemia awareness, or poor blood glucose control even after receiving the best medical treatment you may not be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you:weigh over 85kg (13st 5.4lb) have poor kidney function need a lot of insulin – for example, over 50 units a day for a 70kg (11st) person an islet cell transplant is a minor, low-risk procedure that’s carried out under local anaesthetic. the procedure has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of severe hypos. so far, the results of islet cell transplants carried out in the uk have shown a significant reduction in the number of hypos, from 23 per person per year before transplantation to less than one per person per year afterwards.'}, {'pancreas transplant': ' people with type 1 diabetes who are having a kidney transplant from a donor may also be offered a pancreas transplant at the same time. others may be offered a pancreas transplant after they’ve had a kidney transplant because they’re already on anti-rejection tablets. if you’re having repeated, severe and life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks, a pancreas transplant may also be recommended. during the procedure, your faulty pancreas will be replaced with a healthy pancreas from a donor. this will allow you to get a new source of insulin. pancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there’s a risk of complications. in the uk, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list. the waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there’s a shortage of suitable donor organs.'}, {'treating high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia)': ' hyperglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose levels become too high. it can happen for several reasons, such as eating too much, being unwell or not taking enough insulin. if you develop hyperglycaemia, you may need to adjust your diet or your insulin dose to keep your glucose levels normal. your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this. if hyperglycaemia isn’t treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood. diabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death. the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include:frequently passing urine thirst tiredness and lethargy (lack of energy) blurry vision abdominal (stomach) pain nausea and vomiting deep breathing smell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops) collapse and unconsciousness read more about the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis your healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you’re unwell. if you develop diabetic ketoacidosis, you’ll need urgent hospital treatment. you’ll be given insulin directly into a vein (intravenously). you may also need other fluids given by a drip if you’re dehydrated, including salt solution and potassium.'}, {'other treatments': ' type 1 diabetes can lead to long-term complications. if you have the condition, you have an increased risk of developing heart disease, stroke, eye\xa0and kidney disease. to reduce the chance of this, you may be advised to take:anti-hypertensive medicines to control high blood pressure a statin – such as simvastatin – to reduce high cholesterol levels low-dose aspirin to prevent stroke angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor – such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of a protein called albumin in your urine. it’s often reversible if treated early enough.'}, {'care standards for diabetes': ' the aim of treating diabetes is to help people with the condition control their blood glucose levels and minimise the risk of developing future complications. in scotland there is a national diabetes

nerves and organs. a consistently raised glucose level that doesn’t cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.'}, {'heart disease and stroke': ' if you have diabetes, you’re up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke. prolonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of developing atherosclerosis (furring and narrowing of your blood vessels). this may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing angina (a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking). it also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become completely blocked, leading to a heart attack or stroke.'}, {'nerve damage': ' high blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels of your nerves. this can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. if the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation.'}, {'retinopathy': ' retinopathy\xa0is where the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue) at the back of the eye is damaged. blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. this prevents the light from fully passing through to your retina. if it isn’t treated, it can damage your vision. the better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. having an annual eye check with a specialist (an ophthalmologist or optometrist) can help pick up signs of a potentially serious eye problem early so that it can be treated. treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk. if the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, bp and cholesterol level is recommended. the main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:laser treatment injections of medication into your eyes an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes read about diabetic eye screening'}, {'kidney disease': ' if the small blood vessels in your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently. in rare, severe cases, this can lead to kidney failure\xa0and the need for dialysis (treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys). in some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.'}, {'foot problems': ' damage to the nerves of the foot can mean that small nicks and cuts aren’t noticed, which can lead to a foot ulcer developing. about 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause serious infection. if you develop nerve damage, you should check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist. look out for sores and cuts that don’t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. you should also have a foot examination at least once a year.'}, {'sexual dysfunction': ' in men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. this can usually be treated with

your blood glucose under tight control, particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of the baby developing serious birth defects. you should also take a higher dose of folic acid\xa0tablets. folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems. doctors now recommend that all women planning to have a baby take folic acid. women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg a day until they’re 12 weeks pregnant (only available on prescription). folic acid should be taken alongside pregnancy multivitamins that include\xa0vitamin

type 2 diabetes,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/diabetes/type-2-diabetes/,"[{'about type 2 diabetes': ' diabetes is usually a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high. the hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood there are two main types of diabetes:type 1 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce any insulin type 2 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin this topic is about type 2 diabetes. read more about type 1 diabetes another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear after birth.'}, {'symptoms of diabetes': ' the symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy. your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine. typical symptoms include:feeling very thirsty passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk slow to heal cuts or ulcers frequent vaginal or penile thrush blurred vision read more about the symptoms of type 2 diabetes it’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible as it will get progressively worse if left untreated.'}, {'causes of type 2 diabetes': ' type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. this means glucose stays in the blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy. type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. due to increased obesity, type 2 diabetes is now being seen in young people and all ages. it’s far more common than type 1 diabetes. read about the causes and risk factors for type 2 diabetes'}, {'treating type 2 diabetes': ' type 2 diabetes is treated with changes in your diet and depending on the response of your blood glucose levels, sometimes tablets and insulin. early in the course of type 2 diabetes, planned weight loss can even reverse the disease. read more about the treatment of type 2 diabetes'}, {'complications of type 2 diabetes': ' diabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. it’s the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age. everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year for diabetic retinopathy. diabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure\xa0and lower limb amputation, other than accidents. read more about the complications of type 2 diabetes'}, {'preventing type 2 diabetes': ' if you’re at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes. these include:losing weight if you’re overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight eating a healthy, balanced diet stopping smoking if you smoke drinking alcohol in moderation taking plenty of regular exercise'}, {'living with type 2 diabetes': ' if you already have type 2 diabetes, it may be possible to control your symptoms by making the above changes. this also minimises your risk of developing complications. read more about living with type 2 diabetes'}, {'symptoms of type 2 diabetes': ' the symptoms of diabetes include feeling very thirsty, passing more urine than usual, and feeling tired all the time. the symptoms occur because some or all of the glucose stays in your blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy. your body tries to get rid of the excess glucose in your urine. the main symptoms of\xa0type 2 diabetes are:urinating more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very thirsty feeling very tired unexplained weight loss itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush\xa0(a yeast infection) cuts or wounds that heal slowly blurred vision – caused by the lens of the eye becoming dry the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes are usually obvious and develop very quickly, often over a few weeks. these signs and symptoms aren’t always as obvious, however, and it’s often diagnosed during a routine check-up. this is because they are often mild and develop gradually over a number of years. this means you may have type 2 diabetes for many years without realising it. early diagnosis and treatment for type 2 diabetes is very important as it may reduce your risk of developing complications later on.'}, {'hyperglycaemia': ' type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach, can’t produce enough insulin to control your blood glucose level, or when the cells in your body don’t respond properly to the insulin that is produced. this means your blood glucose levels may become very high, and is known as hyperglycaemia. hyperglycaemia can occur for several reasons, including:eating too much being unwell ineffective diabetes medication not taking enough medication hyperglycaemia causes the main symptoms of diabetes, which include extreme thirst and frequent urination.'}, {'causes of type 2 diabetes': ' type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood glucose level, or the body is unable to use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance). the pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach that produces the hormone insulin. insulin moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it’s converted into energy. in type 2 diabetes, there are several reasons why the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin.'}, {'risk factors for type 2 diabetes': ' four of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes are:age – being over the age of 40 (over 25 for south asian people) genetics – having a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister weight – being overweight or obese ethnicity – being of south asian, chinese, african-caribbean or black african origin, even if you were born in the uk'}, {'other risks': ' your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also increased if your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. this is sometimes called pre-diabetes, and doctors sometimes call it impaired fasting glycaemia (ifg) or impaired glucose tolerance (igt). pre-diabetes is reversible if you lose weight. discuss your options with your gp. pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if you don’t take preventative steps, such as making lifestyle changes. these include\xa0eating healthily,\xa0losing weight\xa0if you’re overweight, and taking plenty of\xa0regular exercise. women who have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy also have a greater risk of developing diabetes in later life.'}, {'treating type 2 diabetes': ''}, {'medicines for type 2 diabetes': ' type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition and\xa0usually gets worse over time. making lifestyle changes, such as adjusting your diet and taking more exercise, may help you control your blood glucose levels at first, but may not be enough in the long term. you may eventually need to take medication to help control your blood glucose levels. initially, this will usually be in the form of tablets and can sometimes be a combination of more than one type of tablet. it may also include insulin or another medication that you inject.'}, {'metformin': ' metformin is usually the first medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. it works by reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases into your bloodstream. it also makes your body’s cells more responsive to insulin. if you’re overweight, it’s also likely you’ll be prescribed metformin. unlike some other medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, metformin shouldn’t cause additional weight gain. however, it can sometimes cause mild side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea, and you may not be able to take it if you have kidney damage.'}, {'sglt2 inhibitors': ' sglt2 inhibitors work by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in urine. they’re particularly useful in people with type 2 diabetes and who have cardiac disease. the three sglt2 inhibitors that may be prescribed include:dapagliflozin canagliflozin empagliflozin each medication is taken as a tablet once a day. the main side effect is a higher risk of genital and urinary tract infections. if you’re unwell and have a dehydrating illness (e.g. fever, vomiting or diarrhoea), it’s important you stop these medications. get your glucose and ketone level checked by your healthcare professional to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis developing.'}, {'glp-1 agonists': ' glp-1 agonists acts in a similar way to the natural hormone glp-1 (see the section on gliptins, below). they’re given by injection and boost your own\xa0insulin production when there are high blood glucose levels, reducing blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycaemia episodes (“hypos”). they’re also particularly useful for people with type 2 diabetes and cardiac disease.'}, {'sulphonylureas': ' sulphonylureas increase the amount of insulin that’s produced by your pancreas. examples include:glibenclamide gliclazide glimepiride glipizide gliquidone you may be prescribed one of these medicines if you can’t take metformin. alternatively, you may be prescribed sulphonylurea and metformin if metformin doesn’t control blood glucose on its own. sulphonylureas can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) because they increase the amount of insulin in your body. they can sometimes cause side effects, including weight gain, nausea and diarrhoea.'}, {'pioglitazone': ' pioglitazone is a type of thiazolidinedione medicine (tzd), which make your body’s cells more sensitive to insulin so more glucose is taken from your blood. it’s usually used in combination with other oral diabetes medication. it may cause weight gain and ankle swelling (oedema). you shouldn’t take pioglitazone if you have heart failure or a high risk of bone fracture.'}, {'gliptins (dpp-4 inhibitors)': ' gliptins work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring hormone called glp-1. glp-1 helps the body produce insulin in response to high blood glucose levels, but is rapidly broken down. by preventing this breakdown, the gliptins (linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) prevent high blood glucose levels, but don’t result in episodes of hypoglycaemia. you may be prescribed a gliptin if you’re unable to take sulphonylureas or glitazones, or in combination with them. they’re not associated with weight gain\xa0and are often used with other oral diabetes medication for those who are obese.'}, {'insulin treatment': ' if glucose-lowering tablets aren’t effective in controlling your blood glucose levels, you may need to have insulin treatment. this can be taken instead of or alongside your tablets, depending on the dose and the way you take it. insulin comes in several different preparations, and each works slightly differently.\xa0your treatment may include a combination of these different insulin preparations.'}, {'insulin injections': ' insulin must be injected because it would be broken down in your stomach like food and unable to enter your bloodstream if it were taken as a tablet. if you need to inject insulin, your diabetes care team will advise you about when you need to do it. they will show you how to inject it yourself, and will also give you advice about storing your insulin and disposing of your needles properly. insulin injections are given using either a syringe or an injection pen, also called an insulin pen (auto-injector). most people need between two and four injections of insulin a day. your gp practice\xa0or diabetes nurse will also teach a relative or a close friend how to inject the insulin properly. you can read more about insulin and how to inject it on the diabetes uk website.'}, {'treatment for low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia)': ' if you have type 2 diabetes that’s controlled using insulin or certain types of tablets (e.g. sulfonylurea), you may experience episodes of hypoglycaemia. hypoglycaemia is where your blood glucose levels become very low. mild hypoglycaemia (a “hypo”) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, but it can usually be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary. if you have a hypo, you should initially have a form of carbohydrate that will act quickly, such as a sugary drink or glucose tablets. this should be followed by a longer-acting carbohydrate, such as a cereal bar, sandwich or piece of fruit. in most cases, these measures will be enough to raise your blood glucose level to normal. you should aim for a hypo to be treated and to recheck your blood glucose level within 15 minutes. if blood glucose still less than 4mmol/l then repeat the treatment using a fast acting carbohydrate. when your blood glucose returns to normal then have your longer acting carbohydrate. if you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you may become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. if this occurs, you may need to have an injection of glucagon into your muscle or glucose into a vein. glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels. you may require input from a health care professional. if the glucagon is not successful, you may require an injection of dextrose into your vein. your diabetes care team can advise you on how to avoid a hypo and what to do if you have one.'}, {'other treatments': ' if you have type 2 diabetes, your risk of developing heart disease, stroke, foot problems, eye\xa0and kidney disease is increased. to reduce your risk of developing other serious health conditions, you may be advised to take other medicines, including:anti-hypertensive medicines to control high blood pressure a statin, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, to reduce high cholesterol low-dose aspirin to prevent a stroke an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor, such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril, if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of albumin (a protein) in your urine. if treated early enough, it may be reversible.'}, {'monitoring blood glucose levels': ' if you have type 2 diabetes, your gp or diabetes care team will need to take a reading of your blood glucose level about every two to six months. this will show how stable your glucose levels have been in the recent past and how well your treatment plan is working. the hba1c test is used to measure blood glucose levels over the previous two to three months. hba1c is a form of haemoglobin, the chemical that carries oxygen in red blood cells, which also has glucose attached to it. a high hba1c level means that your blood glucose level has been consistently high over recent weeks, and your diabetes treatment plan may need to be changed. your diabetes care team can help you set a target hba1c level to aim for. this will usually be less than 53 mmol/mol (7%) or individualised as agreed with your diabetes team. read more about the hba1c test'}, {'monitoring your own blood glucose': ' if you have type 2 diabetes, as well as having your blood glucose level checked by a healthcare professional every two to six months, you may be advised to monitor your own blood glucose levels at home. even if you have a healthy diet and are taking tablets or using insulin therapy, exercise, illness and stress can affect your blood glucose levels. other factors that may affect your blood glucose levels include drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. a blood glucose meter is a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. it can be useful for detecting high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) or low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). if blood glucose monitoring is recommended, you should be trained in how to use a blood glucose meter and what you should do if the reading is too high or too low. blood glucose meters aren’t currently available for free on the nhs but, in some cases, blood monitoring strips may be. ask a member of your diabetes care team if you’re unsure. regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels will ensure your blood glucose is as normal and stable as possible. as your blood glucose level is likely to vary throughout the day, you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you’re taking. in home testing, blood glucose levels are usually measured by how many millimoles of glucose are in a litre of blood. a millimole is a measurement used to define the concentration of glucose in your blood. the measurement is expressed as millimoles per litre, or mmol/l for short. a normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals (preprandial) and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals (postprandial), although this can vary from person to person. your diabetes care team can discuss your blood glucose level with you in more detail. it’s important to know your individual targets.'}, {'complications of type 2 diabetes': ' if diabetes isn’t treated, it can lead to a number of other health problems. high glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs. even a mildly raised glucose level that doesn’t cause any symptoms can have long-term damaging effects.'}, {'heart disease and stroke': ' if you have diabetes, you’re up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke. prolonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of atherosclerosis, where the blood vessels become clogged up and narrowed by fatty substances. this may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing angina (a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking). it also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become blocked, leading to a heart attack or stroke.'}, {'nerve damage': ' high blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels in your nerves. this can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. it can also cause numbness, which can lead to ulceration of the feet. damage to the peripheral nervous system, which includes all parts of the nervous system that lie outside the central nervous system, is known as peripheral neuropathy. if the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\xa0or constipation.'}, {'diabetic retinopathy': ' diabetic retinopathy\xa0is when the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, becomes damaged. blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. this prevents light fully passing through to your retina. if it isn’t treated, it can damage your vision. annual eye checks are usually organised by a regional photographic unit. if significant damage is detected, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (ophthalmologist) such as cataract and glaucoma. the better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk. if the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, bp and cholesterol level is recommended. the main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:laser treatment injections of medication into your eyes an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes read about diabetic eye screening.'}, {'kidney disease': ' if the small blood vessels of your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently. it’s usually associated with high blood pressure, and treating this is a key part of management. in rare, severe cases, kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. this can mean a kidney replacement, treatment with dialysis or sometimes kidney transplantation becomes necessary.'}, {'foot problems': ' damage to the nerves of the foot can mean small nicks and cuts aren’t noticed and this, in combination with poor circulation, can lead to a foot ulcer. about 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause a serious infection. if you have diabetes, look out for sores and cuts that don’t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. you should also have your feet examined at least once a year. if poor circulation or nerve damage is detected, check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist.'}, {'sexual dysfunction': ' in men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. this can usually be treated with medication. women with diabetes may experience:reduced sex drive (loss of libido) less pleasure from sex vaginal dryness less ability to orgasm pain during sex if you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication or find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.'}, {'miscarriage and stillbirth': ' pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. if your blood glucose level isn’t carefully controlled during the early stages of pregnancy, there’s also an increased risk of the baby developing a birth defect. pregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetic clinic, ideally with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy care (an obstetrician). this will allow your care team to keep a close eye on your blood glucose levels and control your insulin dosage more easily, as well as monitoring the growth and development of your baby. the diabetes uk website has more information about diabetes complications.'}, {'looking after your eyes': ' the nhs diabetic eye screening programme will arrange for you to have your eyes checked every year. everyone who is on a diabetes register will be given the opportunity to have a digital picture taken of the back of their eye. speak to your gp to register.'}, {'living with type 2 diabetes': ''}, {'look after your feet': ' if you have diabetes, you’re at greater risk of developing problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes. this is because diabetes is associated with poor blood circulation in the feet, and blood glucose can damage the nerves. to prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water. wear shoes that fit properly, and see foot care specialists (a podiatrist or chiropodist) regularly so any problems can be detected early. regularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes as you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged. see your gp if you have a minor foot injury that doesn’t start to heal within a few days.'}, {'regular eye tests': ' if you have type 2 diabetes, you should be invited to have your eyes screened once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy. diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged. it can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long period of time (hyperglycaemia). left untreated, retinopathy can eventually lead to sight loss. read more about diabetic eye screening people with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can’t be relied upon for other conditions.'}, {'pregnancy': ' if you have diabetes and you’re thinking about having a baby, it’s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team. if you’re taking oral medications to manage your diabetes, this may need to change before you are pregnant. it’s important that you plan your pregnancy and discuss it with your diabetes team. planning your pregnancy means you can ensure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as they can be before you get pregnant. you’ll need to tightly control your blood glucose level – particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of your baby’s development – to reduce the risk of birth defects. you should also:check your medications – some tablets used to treat type 2 diabetes may harm your baby, so you may have to switch to insulin injections, stop statin medication or some blood pressure medications take a higher dose of folic acid tablets – folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems, and it’s recommended all women planning to have a baby take folic acid; women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg each day (only available on prescription) along with pregnancy multivitamins that include vitamin d have your eyes checked – retinopathy, which affects the blood vessels in the eyes, is a risk for all people with diabetes; as pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, it’s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant your gp or diabetes care team can give you further advice.'}, {'diabetes education': ' you’ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes day-to-day if you’re given information and education when you’re diagnosed and on an ongoing

life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare). read more about treating an underactive thyroid\xa0and the complications of an underactive thyroid'}, {'symptoms of an underactive thyroid': ' many symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions, so it can easily be confused for something else. symptoms\xa0usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years. common symptoms include:tiredness being sensitive to cold weight gain constipation depression slow movements and thoughts

an underactive thyroid isn’t treated': ' it’s unlikely that you’d have many of the later symptoms of an underactive thyroid, because the condition is often identified before more serious symptoms appear. later symptoms of an underactive thyroid\xa0include:a low-pitched and hoarse voice a puffy-looking face thinned or partly missing eyebrows a slow heart rate hearing loss anaemia'}, {'causes of an underactive thyroid': ' an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called t4). most cases of an underactive thyroid are caused by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage that occurs as a result of\xa0treatments for\xa0thyroid cancer or an overactive thyroid.'}, {'immune system': ' an underactive thyroid often occurs when the immune system, which usually fights infection, attacks the thyroid gland. this damages the thyroid, which means it’s not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine,\xa0leading to the symptoms of an underactive thyroid. a condition called hashimoto’s disease is the most common type of autoimmune reaction\xa0that\xa0causes an underactive thyroid. it’s not clear what causes hashimoto’s disease, but it runs in families. it’s also common in people with another immune system disorder, such as type 1 diabetes and vitiligo.'}, {'previous thyroid treatment': ' an underactive thyroid can also occur as a side effect or complication of previous treatment to the thyroid gland, such as surgery or a treatment called radioactive iodine therapy. these treatments are sometimes used for an overactive thyroid\xa0(where the thyroid gland\xa0produces too much hormone) or thyroid cancer.'}, {'less common causes': ' worldwide,\xa0a\xa0lack of dietary\xa0iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. however, iodine deficiency is\xa0uncommon in the uk. babies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland doesn’t develop properly in the womb. this is called congenital hypothyroidism and is\xa0uncommon, affecting around 1 in 3,000 babies. it’s\xa0usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth. a problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid.\xa0the pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and\xa0regulates the thyroid. therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid. an underactive thyroid has also been linked to\xa0some viral infections or some\xa0medications used to treat other conditions, such as:lithium – a medication sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, including depression\xa0and\xa0bipolar disorder amiodarone – a medication sometimes used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) interferons – a class of medication sometimes used to treat certain types of\xa0cancer and hepatitis c speak to your gp or specialist if you’re concerned that a medication you’re taking may be affecting your thyroid hormone levels.'}, {'diagnosing an underactive thyroid': ' it’s very important that an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is diagnosed as soon as possible. low levels of thyroid-producing hormones, such as\xa0triiodothyronine (t3) and thyroxine (t4), can change the way the body processes fat. this can cause\xa0high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries), which can potentially lead to serious heart-related problems, such as\xa0angina and heart attack. therefore, you should see your gp and ask for a\xa0blood test\xa0if you repeatedly have symptoms of an underactive thyroid.'}, {'thyroid function test': ' a\xa0blood test measuring your hormone levels is the only accurate way to find out whether\xa0there’s a problem. the test, called a thyroid function test, looks at levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) and thyroxine (t4) in the blood. a\xa0high level of tsh and a low level of\xa0t4 in the blood\xa0could mean you have\xa0an underactive thyroid. if your test results show raised tsh but normal\xa0t4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future. your gp may recommend that you have a repeat blood test every so often to see whether you eventually develop an underactive thyroid. blood tests are also sometimes used for other measurements, such as checking the level of a hormone called\xa0triiodothyronine (t3). however, this isn’t routine, because t3 levels can often remain normal, even if you have a significantly underactive thyroid. the\xa0lab tests online uk\xa0website has more information about the different types of thyroid function tests.'}, {'referral': ' your gp may refer you to an endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone disorders) if you:are younger than 16 are pregnant or trying to get pregnant have just given birth have another health condition, such as heart disease, which may complicate your medication are taking a medication known to cause a reduction in thyroid hormones, such as amiodarone or lithium'}, {'treating an underactive thyroid': ' an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine. levothyroxine\xa0replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid doesn’t make enough of. you’ll initially have regular\xa0blood tests until the correct dose\xa0of levothyroxine is reached. this\xa0can take a little while to get right. you may start on a low dose of levothyroxine, which may be increased gradually, depending on how your body responds.\xa0some people start to feel better\xa0soon after beginning treatment,\xa0while others\xa0don’t notice an improvement in their symptoms for several months once you’re taking the correct dose, you’ll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels. if\xa0blood tests suggest you may have an underactive thyroid, but you don’t have any symptoms or they’re very mild, you may not need any treatment. in these cases, your gp will usually monitor your hormone levels every few months and prescribe levothyroxine if you develop symptoms.'}, {'taking levothyroxine': ' if you’re prescribed levothyroxine, you should take 1 tablet at the same time every day.\xa0it’s usually recommended that you take the tablets in the morning, although some people prefer to take them at night. the effectiveness of the\xa0tablets can be altered by other medications, supplements or foods, so they should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach, and you should avoid eating for 30 minutes afterwards. if you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, if this is within a few hours of your usual time. if you don’t remember until later than this, skip the dose and take the next dose at the usual time, unless\xa0advised otherwise by your doctor. an underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, so you’ll usually need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life.'}, {'combination therapy': ' in the uk, combination therapy – using levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (t3) together – isn’t routinely used because there’s insufficient evidence to show it’s better than using levothyroxine alone (monotherapy). in most cases,\xa0suppressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) using high dose thyroid replacement therapy should be avoided because it carries a risk of causing adverse side effects, such as\xa0atrial fibrillation (an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate), strokes, osteoporosis and fracture. however, this type of treatment may sometimes be recommended in cases where a person has a history of\xa0thyroid cancer and there’s a significant risk of it reoccurring.'}, {'complications of an underactive thyroid': ' several complications can occur if you have an underactive thyroid that isn’t treated.'}, {'heart problems': ' if you have an untreated underactive thyroid, your risk of developing cardiovascular disease\xa0is increased. this is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood.\xa0high cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries, restricting\xa0the flow of blood. contact your doctor if you’re being treated for an underactive thyroid and you develop chest pain, so that any problems can be\xa0detected and treated, if necessary.'}, {'goitre': ' a\xa0goitre\xa0is an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland that causes a lump to form in the throat. goitres can develop in people with an underactive thyroid\xa0when the body tries to\xa0stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones.'}, {'pregnancy complications': ' if an underactive thyroid isn’t treated during pregnancy, there’s a risk of problems occurring. these\xa0include:pre-eclampsia – which can cause\xa0high blood pressure and fluid retention\xa0in the mother and growth problems in the baby anaemia\xa0in the mother an underactive thyroid in the baby birth defects bleeding after birth problems with the baby’s physical and mental development premature birth or a low birthweight stillbirth\xa0or miscarriage these problems can usually be avoided with treatment under the guidance of a specialist in hormone disorders (an endocrinologist). therefore, tell your gp if you have an underactive thyroid and you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant.'}, {'myxoedema coma': ' in very rare cases, a severe underactive thyroid may lead to a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma. this is where the thyroid hormone levels become very low, causing symptoms such as confusion, hypothermia\xa0and drowsiness. myxoedema coma requires emergency treatment in hospital. it’s usually treated with thyroid hormone replacement medication given directly into a vein. in some cases, other treatments such as breathing support,\xa0antibiotics and steroid medication (corticosteroids) are also required.'}, {'help us improve nhs inform': ''},

dry skin and colour changes in the lower leg your gp can diagnose varicose veins based on these symptoms, although further tests may be carried out.'}, {'why\xa0do varicose veins\xa0happen?': ' varicose veins develop when the small valves inside the veins stop working properly. in a healthy vein, blood flows smoothly to the heart. the blood is prevented from flowing backwards by a series of tiny valves\xa0that open and close to let blood through. if the valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and collect in the vein, eventually causing it to be swollen and enlarged (varicose). certain things can increase your chances of developing varicose veins, such as:pregnancy being overweight old age'}, {'who is affected?': ' varicose veins are a\xa0common condition, affecting up to\xa03 in 10 adults. women are more likely to develop them than men. any vein in the body can become varicose, but they most commonly develop in the legs and feet, particularly in the calves. this is because standing and walking puts extra pressure on the veins in the lower body.'}, {'causes of varicose veins': ' varicose veins are usually caused by weak vein walls and valves.'}, {'weakened valves': ' inside your veins are tiny one-way valves that open to let the blood through and then close to prevent it flowing backwards. sometimes the walls of the veins become stretched and lose their elasticity, causing the valves to weaken. if the valves don’t function properly, this can cause the blood to leak and flow backwards. if this happens, the blood will collect in your veins, which will become swollen and enlarged. the reasons why the walls of the veins stretch and the valves in your veins weaken are not fully understood. some people develop the condition for no obvious or apparent reason.'}, {'increased risk': ' a number of things can increase your likelihood of developing varicose veins, including:gender genetics age being overweight occupation being pregnant other conditions'}, {'gender': ' women are more likely to be affected by varicose veins than men. research suggests this may be because female hormones tend to relax the walls of veins, making the valves more prone to leaking. hormones are chemicals produced by the body, and changes may be caused by pregnancy, premenstrual syndrome or the menopause.'}, {'genetics': ' your risk of developing varicose veins is increased if a close family member has the condition. this suggests varicose veins may be partly caused by your genes (the units of genetic material you inherit from your parents).'}, {'age': ' as you get older, your veins start to lose their elasticity and the valves inside them stop working as well.'}, {'being overweight': ' being overweight puts extra pressure on your veins, which means they have to work harder to send the blood back to your heart. this can put increased pressure on the valves, making them more prone to leaking. the impact of body weight on the development of varicose veins appears to be more significant in women. use a healthy weight calculator to check whether you are overweight.'}, {'occupation': ' some research suggests jobs that require long periods of standing may increase your risk of getting varicose veins. this is because your blood does not flow as easily when you are standing for long periods of time.'}, {'pregnancy': ' during pregnancy, the amount of blood increases to help support the developing baby. this puts extra strain on your veins. increased hormone levels during pregnancy also cause the muscular walls of the blood vessels to relax, which also increases your risk. varicose veins may also develop as the womb (uterus) begins to grow. as the womb expands it puts pressure on veins in your pelvic area, which can sometimes cause them to become varicose. although being pregnant can increase your risk of developing varicose veins, most women find their veins significantly improve after the baby is born.'}, {'other conditions': ' in rare cases, varicose veins are caused by other conditions. these include:a previous blood clot a swelling or tumour in the pelvis abnormal blood vessels'}, {'symptoms of varicose veins': ' varicose veins are dark purple or blue in colour and are usually twisted and bulging in appearance. some people with varicose veins may experience pain or discomfort. as well as their distinctive

itchy and thin skin over the affected vein these symptoms are usually worse during warm weather or if you’ve been standing up for long periods of time. they may improve when you walk around or if you rest and raise your legs. pillows are a good way to raise your legs comfortably. varicose veins usually develop on the legs, either on the back of your calf or on the inside of your leg. however, they

ablation': ' one of the first treatments offered will usually be endothermal ablation. this\xa0involves using energy either from high-frequency radio waves (radiofrequency ablation) or lasers (endovenous laser treatment) to seal the affected veins. these treatments are described in more detail below.'}, {'ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy': ' if endothermal ablation treatment is unsuitable for you, you’ll usually be offered a treatment called sclerotherapy instead. this treatment involves injecting special foam into your veins. the foam scars the veins, which seals them closed. this type of treatment may not be suitable if you have previously had deep vein thrombosis. the injection is guided to the vein using an ultrasound scan. it’s possible to treat more than one vein in the same session.\xa0both standard sclerotherapy and foam sclerotherapy are usually carried out under local anaesthetic, where a painkilling medication will be used to numb the area being treated. after sclerotherapy, your varicose veins should begin to fade after a few weeks as stronger veins take over the role of the damaged vein, which is no longer filled with blood. you may require treatment more than once before the vein fades, and there is a chance the vein may reappear. although sclerotherapy has proven to be effective, it’s not yet known how effective foam sclerotherapy is in the long term.\xa0nice found, on average, the treatment was effective in 84 out of 100 cases. however, in one study, the varicose veins returned in\xa0more than\xa0half of those treated.

leg. these bandages are designed to squeeze your legs and encourage blood to flow upwards, towards your heart. there are many different types of bandage\xa0or elastic stockings used to treat venous leg ulcers, which\xa0may be made\xa0in 2, 3\xa0or 4\xa0different layers. the application of a compression bandage is a skilled procedure and they should only be applied by trained healthcare staff. the bandage is changed once a week, when the dressing is changed. when compression bandages are first applied to an unhealthy ulcer, it’s usually painful.\xa0ideally, you should have\xa0paracetamol or an alternative painkiller prescribed by your gp.\xa0the pain will lessen once the ulcer starts to heal, but this can take up to 10-12 days. it’s important to wear your compression bandage exactly as instructed. if you have any problems, it’s usually best to contact your nurse, instead of trying to remove it yourself. if the compression bandage feels a little too tight and is uncomfortable in bed at night, getting up for a short walk will usually help. however,\xa0you’ll need to cut the bandage off if:you get severe pain at the front of your ankle you get severe pain on the top of your foot your toes become blue and swollen once you remove the bandage,\xa0make sure you keep your leg highly elevated and contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. in some clinics, specialist teams

affects the female reproductive system. it’s also called uterine cancer and endometrial cancer. abnormal vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of womb cancer. if you have been through the menopause, any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal. if you have not yet been through the menopause, unusual bleeding may include bleeding between your periods. you should speak to your gp as soon as possible if you experience any unusual vaginal bleeding. while it’s unlikely\xa0to be\xa0caused by womb cancer, it’s best to be sure. your gp will examine you and ask about your symptoms. they will refer you to a specialist for further tests if they suspect you may have a serious problem, or if they are unsure about a diagnosis. read more about the\xa0symptoms of womb cancer and diagnosing womb cancer'}, {'types of womb cancer': ' the vast majority of womb cancers\xa0begin in the cells that make up the lining of the\xa0womb (called the endometrium), which is why cancer of the womb\xa0is often called endometrial cancer. in rare cases, womb cancer can start in the muscles surrounding the womb. this type of cancer is called uterine sarcoma and may be treated in a different way from endometrial cancer. this article uses the term womb cancer, and\xa0mostly includes information about endometrial cancer. read more information about soft tissue sarcomas. womb cancer is separate\xa0from other cancers of the female reproductive system, such as\xa0ovarian cancer and cervical cancer.'}, {'why does womb cancer happen?': ' it’s not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition. a hormone imbalance is one of the most important risks for womb cancer. specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body. a number of\xa0things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, and\xa0hormone replacement therapy (hrt).\xa0there is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. it’s not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. this includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of contraception. read more about the causes of womb cancer'}, {'how is womb cancer treated?': ' the most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy). a hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but\xa0you\xa0will no longer be able to get pregnant.\xa0surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. radiotherapy or\xa0chemotherapy\xa0are also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery. a type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children. even if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life. read more about treating womb cancer'}, {'living with womb cancer': ' living with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways. for example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. you may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive. you may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer. read more about living with womb cancer'}, {'who is affected?': ' womb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. it’s the fourth most common cancer diagnosed\xa0in women after breast cancer, lung cancer, and cancer of the colon and rectum. womb cancer is more common in women and anyone with a womb who has been through the menopause. most cases are diagnosed in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.'}, {'symptoms of womb cancer': ' the most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don’t have cancer. bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the menopause, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual. in women and anyone with a womb who hasn’t been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of:periods that are heavier than usual vaginal bleeding in between normal periods less common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex. if womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. these include:pain in the back, legs, or pelvis loss of appetite tiredness nausea'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' if you have\xa0postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your gp. only\xa01 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by\xa0womb cancer, so it’s unlikely your symptoms\xa0will be caused by this condition. however, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it’s important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated.\xa0the bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as:endometriosis\xa0– where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb fibroids\xa0– non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus polyps in the womb lining other types of gynaecological cancer can also\xa0cause unusual\xa0vaginal bleeding, particularly cervical cancer. read further information:cancer research uk: womb cancer symptoms macmillan: symptoms of womb cancer'}, {'causes of womb cancer': ' it’s not known exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing it. cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. if left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.'}, {'increased risk': ' a number of things have been identified that\xa0increase the risk of developing\xa0womb cancer.'}, {'diagnosing womb cancer': ' you should visit your gp if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. while it’s unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it’s best to be sure. your gp will probably carry out a physical examination of your pelvic area, including your vagina, womb, ovaries, and bladder. they will ask about your symptoms, when they happen, and how often. you may be referred to a specialist in conditions of the female reproductive organs (a gynaecologist) for further tests. in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected endometrial cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.'}, {'transvaginal ultrasound (tvu)': ' another test you may have is called a transvaginal ultrasound (tvu). tvu is a type of\xa0ultrasound scan that uses a small scanner in the form of a probe. this is placed directly into the vagina to obtain a detailed picture of the inside of the uterus. the probe can feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be painful. the tvu checks whether there are any changes to the thickness of the lining of your uterus that could be caused by the presence of cancerous cells.'}, {'biopsy': ' if the results of the tvu detect changes in the thickness of the lining of the uterus, you will usually have a\xa0biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. in\xa0a biopsy, a small sample of cells is taken from the lining of the womb (the endometrium). the sample is then checked at a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells. the biopsy can be carried out in\xa0several ways, including:aspiration biopsy – a small flexible tube is inserted into your vagina and up into your womb, and then sucks up a small sample of cells hysteroscopy – this allows the doctor to look at the inside of the womb using a thin type of telescope called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through your vagina and into your womb, allowing the doctor to look at the lining of the womb and take a sample from it in some cases, a hysteroscopy\xa0may be used before dilatation and curettage (d&c). d&c is a minor surgical procedure\xa0carried out under general anaesthetic,\xa0where some tissue from the womb lining is removed. the tissue\xa0is then sent off to a laboratory for further testing.'}, {'blood test': ' a blood test can sometimes help diagnose womb cancer. this is because some cancerous tumours release certain chemicals into your blood, known as tumour markers, which can be detected during a blood test. however, this type of test isn’t very reliable. the presence of these chemicals doesn’t mean you definitely have womb cancer. some people with womb cancer don’t have these chemicals in their blood. read further information:cancer research uk: womb cancer tests macmillan: how womb cancer is

doctors to work out how large the cancer is, whether or not it has spread, and the best treatment options for you. these tests may include:a\xa0chest x-ray\xa0– where radiation is used to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs magnetic resonance imaging (mri)\xa0– where magnetic fields are used to create a\xa0detailed image of the inside of your body\xa0to check if the cancer has spread a computerised tomography (ct) scan\xa0– where a series of x-rays are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body\xa0to check if the cancer has spread further blood tests –\xa0these are usually done\xa0to check your general health and how well some of your organs are functioning read treating womb cancer for more information about staging.'}, {'treating womb cancer': ' health professionals use a staging system to describe how far womb cancer has advanced. these stages are:stage 1 –\xa0the cancer is still contained inside the womb (uterus) stage 2 – the cancer has spread to the neck of the womb (the cervix) stage 3 –\xa0the cancer has spread outside the womb into nearby tissues in the pelvis or the lymph nodes stage 4 –\xa0the cancer has spread to the soft tissues of the

{'treatment if you haven’t been through the menopause': ' having a hysterectomy means you will\xa0no longer be\xa0able to get pregnant. younger women who haven’t already reached the menopause may not want to have their womb and ovaries removed if they wish to have children. in this case, under very specific circumstances it may be possible to treat the cancer using hormone therapy.'}, {'treating advanced cancer': ' advanced womb cancer\xa0requires a different course of treatment, usually depending more on chemotherapy. advanced cancer may not be curable, but the treatment aims to achieve a remission, where the cancer shrinks, making you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full. even if there’s no chance of a cure, surgery may be carried out to remove as much of the cancer as possible. radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy can reduce symptoms such as pain by shrinking the cancer or slowing its growth. read further information:cancer research uk: controlling

thinks there’s a significant risk the cancer could return in the pelvis. radiotherapy may also be used to slow the spread of cancer when a surgical cure is not possible. there are 2\xa0types of radiotherapy used to treat\xa0womb cancer:internal radiotherapy (also known as brachytherapy)\xa0– where\xa0a plastic tube is inserted inside the uterus and radiation treatment is passed down the tube into the womb external radiotherapy –\xa0where\xa0a machine is used to deliver pulses of radiation to your pelvis a course of external radiotherapy is usually given to you as an outpatient for 5\xa0days a week with a break at the weekend. the treatment takes a few minutes. the whole course of radiotherapy may last approximately 4\xa0weeks depending on the stage and position of the womb cancer. some women and anyone with a womb have internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) as well as external radiotherapy. during brachytherapy, the device that delivers radiation is placed in your vagina. there are different types of brachytherapy, involving either low, medium, or high dose rates. with low dose rate methods the radiation is delivered more slowly, so the device has to stay inside you for longer. you’ll have to stay in hospital while you have the treatment. your doctor will discuss this with you. radiotherapy has some side effects. skin in the treated area can become red and sore, and hair loss may occur. radiotherapy to the pelvic area can affect the bowel and cause sickness and diarrhoea. as your course of treatment progresses, you’re likely to get very tired. most of these side effects will go away when your treatment finishes.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' if you have stage\xa03 or\xa04\xa0womb cancer, you may be given a course of chemotherapy. chemotherapy can be used after surgery to try to prevent the return of the cancer. in cases of advanced cancer, it may be used to slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms. chemotherapy is usually given as an injection into the vein (intravenously). you’ll usually be able to go home the same day you have chemotherapy, but sometimes you may need a short stay in hospital. chemotherapy is usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment being followed by a period of rest to allow the body to recover. side effects of chemotherapy can include:nausea vomiting hair loss fatigue there is also an increased risk of an infection developing in your bloodstream (sepsis), as your body’s ability to fight infection is reduced by chemotherapy. the side effects should stop once treatment has finished.

febrile seizures is unknown, although they’re linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above). in most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as:chickenpox flu (influenza) middle ear infections (otitis media) tonsillitis there may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures because the chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them. around one in four children affected by febrile seizures has a family history of the condition. read more about the causes of febrile seizures'}, {'complications': ' febrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk of epilepsy, as well as other problems. recent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (sudc), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy. however, this link hasn’t been proven and sudc is incredibly rare, affecting around one in 100,000 children which is equivalent to a 0.001% chance. in addition, one of the biggest studies of its kind looked at more than 1.5 million children with a history of febrile seizures and found no evidence of an

seizures are linked to fevers, but the exact cause is unknown. some researchers think that the biological processes associated with a high temperature may be responsible. a high temperature is thought to be caused by a bacterial or viral infection that stimulates the release of cytokines. cytokines are proteins that affect the parts of the brain and nervous system responsible for regulating the body’s temperature. their release causes a rise in the body’s temperature. one theory is that in certain people, high levels of cytokines may temporarily ‘scramble’ the workings of the brain and nervous system, triggering a seizure.'}, {'family history': ' although\xa0febrile seizures are poorly understood, a family history of the conditions is thought to increase the risk. if a child has a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister or brother) with a history of febrile seizures, their risk of having seizures increases. the more relatives affected, the higher the risk. this is

while there’s probably nothing seriously wrong with your child, it’s best to be sure. don’t put anything, including medication,\xa0in your child’s mouth while they’re having a seizure. there’s a slight chance that they might bite their tongue, although any damage isn’t usually serious and will heal within a few days. trying to stop someone biting their tongue by placing your hand or an object in their mouth could be dangerous both for you and for\xa0them.'}, {'high temperature (fever)': ' reducing a high temperature can help make your child feel more comfortable. paracetamol\xa0and\xa0ibuprofen have been shown to be effective in reducing a high temperature. however, they won’t reduce the\xa0chances of your child actually having a seizure. removing any unnecessary clothes and bedding will also help to lower your child’s temperature. aspirin should never be given to children\xa0under 16 years of age because there’s a small risk that the medication could trigger a condition called reye’s syndrome, which can cause brain and liver damage. the use of cold sponges or fans isn’t recommended for treating a high temperature. there’s little evidence that they’re effective, and they may cause your child discomfort. your gp will be able to give you additional advice about treating the underlying cause of your child’s high temperature. it’s also important to prevent\xa0dehydration during a fever by making sure your child drinks plenty of fluids.'}, {'recurring febrile seizures': ' about one third of children will have a febrile seizure again during a subsequent infection. this often occurs within a year of the first febrile seizure. recurrence is more likely if:the first febrile seizure occurred before your child was 18 months old there’s a history of seizures or epilepsy\xa0in your family before having the first seizure your child had a fever that lasted less than one\xa0hour or their temperature was less than 40c (104f) your child has multiple seizures during the same febrile episode (complex febrile seizure) your child attends a day care nursery (this increases their chances of developing common childhood infections, such as the\xa0flu or chickenpox) it’s\xa0not recommended that your child is given a prescription of regular medicines to prevent further febrile seizures. this is because the adverse side effects associated with many medicines outweigh any risks\xa0of the seizures themselves. research has shown that the use of medication to control fever\xa0isn’t likely to prevent recurrence of further febrile seizures. however, there may be exceptional circumstances where medication to prevent recurrent febrile seizures is recommended. for example, children may need medication if they have a low threshold for having seizures during illness, particularly if the seizures are prolonged. in this case, your child may be prescribed medications such as diazepam or lorazepam to take at the start of a fever. children who’ve had a febrile seizure following a routine vaccination (which is very rare), are no more at risk of having another seizure compared to children who’ve had a seizure due to another cause for fever.'}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been received'}]"

chest groin both sides of the body are usually affected equally – for example, both feet or both hands. the sweating doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to\xa0your health, but it can be embarrassing and distressing. it can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to\xa0feelings of depression and anxiety. read more about the complications of hyperhidrosis.'}, {'what is excessive sweating?': ' there are no guidelines to determine what “normal” sweating is, but if you feel you sweat\xa0too much\xa0and\xa0your sweating\xa0has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis. for example, you may have hyperhidrosis if:you\xa0avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands,\xa0because you\xa0feel self-conscious about your sweating you

your symptoms, although occasionally you may need blood and urine tests to\xa0check for an underlying cause (see below).'}, {'what causes hyperhidrosis?': ' in many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. this is known as primary hyperhidrosis. hyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. this can have many different triggers, including:pregnancy or the menopause anxiety certain medications low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) infections read more about the causes of hyperhidrosis.'}, {'how hyperhidrosis is treated': ' excessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a

hyperhidrosis': ' hyperhidrosis that has no obvious cause is known as primary hyperhidrosis. although it’s not clear\xa0why it\xa0develops, it’s thought to be the result of a problem with part of the

man-made fibres, such as nylon wearing black or white clothing can\xa0minimise signs of sweating armpit shields can absorb excessive sweat and protect your clothes wear socks that absorb moisture, such as thick socks made of natural fibres, or special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture avoid wearing socks made out of man-made materials and change your socks at least twice a day

doesn’t\xa0control your sweating, your gp may prescribe\xa0or suggest\xa0a stronger one for you. antiperspirant containing aluminium chloride is often used to treat hyperhidrosis. this works by plugging the sweat glands. you will need to apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning. the most common side effect of aluminium chloride is mild irritation or itching and tingling where it is applied. using the antiperspirant less frequently can help reduce irritation. using emollients (moisturisers) regularly and soap substitutes instead of soap may also help.'}, {'anticholinergics': ' you may be prescribed a type of medicine called an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic. these work by blocking the effects of a chemical called acetylcholine, which the nervous system uses to activate the sweat glands. anticholinergics are available as tablets or solutions that are applied to affected areas. they’re not widely used to treat hyperhidrosis and most types are not licensed to treat it, but some people find them helpful. propantheline bromide is an anticholinergic medicine licensed for treating hyperhidrosis. however, anticholinergic medicines unlicensed for hyperhidrosis – such as oxybutynin and glycopyrronium bromide – can also be prescribed if your doctor feels they might help. possible side effects of anticholinergics include a dry mouth, blurred vision, stomach cramps, constipation and difficulty passing urine.'}, {'referral to a dermatologist': ' if lifestyle changes and treatment don’t work, your gp may refer you to a

hyperhidrosis is particularly severe and treatment\xa0hasn’t been successful, surgery may be recommended.'}, {'treating anxiety': ' feelings of anxiety are not directly responsible for causing primary hyperhidrosis, but they can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle. you may feel self-conscious, which can trigger anxiety in certain situations, such as when meeting new people or being in a crowded room. the anxiety can make the sweating worse. if your anxiety is making your sweating worse, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt)\xa0might help. medication for anxiety is not usually recommended because it can make sweating worse.'}, {'complications of hyperhidrosis': ' hyperhidrosis doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can sometimes lead to physical and emotional problems.'}, {'fungal infections': ' hyperhidrosis increases the risk of developing fungal infections, particularly\xa0on the feet\xa0– most\xa0commonly fungal nail infections and athlete’s foot. this is because excessive sweat combined\xa0with wearing socks and shoes creates an ideal surrounding for fungi to grow. fungal infections can be treated with antifungal creams. more severe cases may require antifungal tablets or capsules.'}, {'skin conditions': ' excessive sweat can make you more vulnerable to\xa0certain skin conditions, such as:warts\xa0– small, rough lumps on the skin that are caused by the hpv virus boils\xa0– swollen red-yellow bumps in the skin that can develop when a hair follicle becomes infected eczema can\xa0also be made worse by excessive sweating.'}, {'body odour': ' although people with hyperhidrosis sweat a lot, most don’t have problems with body odour. this is because hyperhidrosis doesn’t usually affect the sweat glands responsible for producing unpleasant-smelling sweat – called the aprocrine sweat glands. however, if bacteria are allowed to break down the sweat, it can start to smell unpleasant. eating spicy food and drinking alcohol can also make sweat secreted from the eccrine smell. this can be prevented or eased by following lifestyle advice, such as frequently using antiperspirant spray and using armpit shields to absorb sweat. see treating hyperhidrosis for more information.'}, {'emotional impact': ' the emotional impact of living with hyperhidrosis can be severe. many people with the condition feel unhappy and, in some cases, depressed. signs that you may be depressed include:feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during the past month having little interest or pleasure in

a kidney infection each year in the uk. they can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. in fact, women are 6 times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. this is because a woman’s urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys. younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection. younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys.'}, {'can kidney infections be prevented?': ' you can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection

then your kidneys. it’s thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by\xa0accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. this can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. it can also happen during sex. in rare cases, a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. however, this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems.'}, {'who’s most likely to get a kidney infection?': ' women and children are most at risk of developing a kidney infection, as well as other urinary tract infections (utis) such as cystitis. in women, the urethra is closer to the anus than in men, making it easier for bacteria from the anus to\xa0enter the urethra accidentally. the female urethra is also much shorter than the male urethra (which runs through the penis). this makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and move into the kidneys. other\xa0factors can also put you more at risk of developing a kidney infection, including:having a condition that blocks, or obstructs, your urinary tract, such as kidney stones\xa0or an enlarged prostate\xa0– children with constipation can also be at an increased risk being born with an abnormality in your urinary tract having a condition that prevents you emptying your bladder fully, such as an injury to your spinal cord\xa0– this can allow bacteria in your bladder to multiply and spread having a weakened immune system – for example, due to type 2 diabetes or as a side effect of chemotherapy having an infection of the prostate gland called prostatitis\xa0–\xa0the infection can spread from the prostate gland into the kidneys having a\xa0urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube inserted into your bladder to drain away urine) being female and sexually active\xa0– sexual intercourse can irritate the urethra and allow bacteria to travel into your bladder being a man who has anal sex\xa0– bacteria can travel up the urethra into the bladder being pregnant\xa0– this can cause physical changes that slow the flow of urine out of your body and make it easier for bacteria to spread to the kidneys having undergone\xa0female genital mutilation (fgm)\xa0– an illegal practice where a\xa0woman’s genitals\xa0are

children with a kidney infection will be treated in hospital. hospital treatment may also be needed\xa0if:you’re severely dehydrated you’re unable to swallow or keep down any fluids or medications you have additional symptoms that suggest you may have\xa0blood poisoning, such as a rapid heartbeat and losing consciousness you’re pregnant and you also have a high temperature you’re particularly frail and\xa0your general health is poor your symptoms fail to improve within 24 hours of starting treatment with antibiotics you have a weakened immune system you have a foreign body inside your urinary tract, such as a kidney stone or a urinary catheter you have diabetes you’re over the age of 65 you have an underlying condition that affects the\xa0way your\xa0kidneys work, such as\xa0polycystic kidney disease or\xa0chronic kidney disease if you’re admitted to hospital with a kidney infection, you’ll probably be attached to a drip so\xa0you can be given fluids to help keep you hydrated. antibiotics can also be\xa0given through the drip. you’ll have regular blood and urine tests to monitor your health and how effectively the antibiotics\xa0are fighting off the infection. most people respond well to treatment. as long as there are\xa0no complications, they’re usually well enough to leave hospital within three to seven days.\xa0treatment will usually switch to tablets or capsules after you stop receiving\xa0antibiotics through a drip.'}, {'complications of kidney infections': ' most kidney infections are treated successfully without complications, although some people may develop further problems. complications of a kidney infection are rare, but you’re more likely to\xa0develop them if you:are a child are\xa0over 65 are pregnant have\xa0diabetes, chronic kidney

risk of developing a kidney abscess if you have diabetes. the symptoms of a kidney abscess are similar to those of a kidney infection. the most common are:a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above chills abdominal pain loss of appetite pain when passing urine kidney abscesses are potentially serious because the bacteria inside the abscess can spread to other parts of\xa0your body, such as\xa0your bloodstream or lungs, and can be fatal. smaller abscesses can usually be treated with antibiotics through a drip. surgery is usually required for larger abscesses. this involves draining\xa0the pus out of the abscess using a needle that’s inserted into the kidney.'}, {'blood poisoning': ' blood poisoning (also called sepsis) is another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection.\xa0it happens when bacteria spreads from the kidneys into the bloodstream. once bacteria are\xa0in your blood, the infection can spread to any part of your body, including all of the major organs. in\xa0someone with a kidney infection, the\xa0symptoms of blood poisoning include:low blood pressure, which makes you feel dizzy when you stand up confusion or disorientation excessive sweating uncontrollable shaking or shivering high temperature or lower body temperature than usual (under 36c, or 96.8f) pale skin rapid heartbeat breathlessness blood poisoning\xa0is a medical emergency that usually requires admission to a hospital\xa0intensive care unit (icu) while antibiotics are used to fight the infection. if you’re taking certain medications for diabetes, such as metformin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, they may be temporarily withdrawn until you recover. this is because they can cause kidney damage during an episode of blood poisoning.'}, {'severe infection': ' another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection is a condition called emphysematous pyelonephritis (epn). epn is a severe infection, where the tissues of the kidneys are rapidly destroyed and the bacteria causing\xa0the infection begin to release a toxic gas, which builds up inside the kidneys. the exact cause of epn is unclear, but almost all cases\xa0are in people with diabetes. the usual treatment is emergency surgery to remove some, or all, of the affected kidney. it’s possible to live\xa0a full and active life\xa0with only one kidney.'}, {'kidney failure': ' in very rare cases, a kidney infection can cause severe kidney damage that results in kidney failure. this is when the kidneys stop working properly. kidney failure is potentially fatal, but it can be treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant.'}, {'other problems': ' a kidney infection can also cause other complications, including\xa0high blood pressure (hypertension)\xa0or premature labour or birth.'}, {'preventing kidney infections': ' the best way to prevent a kidney infection is to keep your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. these self-help tips explain how\xa0you can do this.'}, {'drink plenty of liquids': ' drinking plenty of liquids, particularly water, will help to wash bacteria from your bladder and urinary tract. drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry extracts may also help prevent urinary tract infections (utis).\xa0however, you should\xa0avoid cranberry juice or extracts if you’re taking warfarin, a medicine used to prevent blood clots.\xa0cranberry juice can make the effects of warfarin more potent, so there’s a risk of excessive bleeding.'}, {'toilet tips': ' to help keep your\xa0urinary tract\xa0free from bacteria:go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in wipe from front to back after going to the toilet practice good hygiene by washing your genitals every day and before having sex empty your bladder after having sex if you’re a woman,\xa0avoid ‘hovering’ over a toilet seat as this position can often leave urine behind in the bladder'}, {'treat constipation': ' constipation can increase your chances of developing a urinary tract infection\xa0(uti), so\xa0try to\xa0treat\xa0any constipation\xa0promptly. recommended

lactose intolerance,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/lactose-intolerance/,"[{'about lactose intolerance': ' lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products. symptoms of lactose intolerance\xa0usually develop within a few hours of consuming food\xa0or drink that contains lactose. they may include:flatulence (wind) diarrhoea bloated stomach stomach cramps and pains stomach rumbling feeling sick the severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you’ve consumed. some people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee.'}, {'when to seek medical advice': ' the symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it’s important to see your gp for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet. for example, the symptoms above can also be caused by:irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)\xa0– a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system milk protein intolerance – an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk allergy) if your gp thinks\xa0you\xa0have lactose intolerance,\xa0they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve. read more about diagnosing lactose intolerance'}, {'what causes lactose intolerance?': ' the body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. this breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream. people with\xa0lactose intolerance\xa0don’t produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it’s fermented by bacteria. this leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. depending on the underlying reason why the body isn’t producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks. read more about the causes of lactose intolerance'}, {'who’s affected?': ' in the uk, lactose intolerance is more common in people of asian or african-caribbean descent. lactose intolerance can develop at any age. many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected.'}, {'is it an allergy?': ' lactose\xa0intolerance isn’t the same as a milk or dairy allergy. food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. this\xa0causes symptoms such as\xa0a rash, wheezing and itching. if you’re allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person).'}, {'treating lactose intolerance': ' there’s no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to\xa0control the symptoms. depending on what dairy products you’re able to eat, you may also require additional\xa0calcium\xa0and\xa0vitamin d\xa0supplements to keep\xa0your bones strong and healthy. in some cases, your gp may refer you to a dietitian for further advice. in addition to dietary

other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. these\xa0vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. if you’re lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. this may lead to unhealthy weight loss and\xa0put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions:osteopenia –\xa0where you have a very low bone-mineral density. if osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. osteoporosis – where your bones become thin and weak. if you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased. malnutrition – when the food you eat doesn’t give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. if you’re malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed. if you’re concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. they can

british dietetic association has information on how to find a private dietitian.'}, {'causes of lactose intolerance': ' lactose intolerance is usually the result of your body not producing enough lactase. lactase is an enzyme (a protein that causes a chemical reaction to occur) normally produced in your small intestine that’s used to digest lactose. if you have a lactase deficiency, it means your body doesn’t produce enough lactase.'}, {'digesting lactose': ' after eating or drinking something containing lactose, it passes down your oesophagus (gullet) into your stomach, where it’s digested. the digested food then passes into your small intestine. the lactase in your small intestine should break lactose down into glucose and galactose (other types of sugar), which are then absorbed into your bloodstream. if there isn’t enough lactase, the unabsorbed lactose moves through your digestive system to your colon (large intestine). bacteria in the colon ferment (break down) the lactose, producing fatty acids and gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. the breakdown of the lactose in the colon, and the resulting acids and gases that are produced, cause the symptoms of lactose intolerance such as flatulence and bloating.'}, {'types of lactase deficiency': ' the main types of lactase deficiency are outlined below.'}, {'diagnosing lactose intolerance': ' it’s important to visit your gp if you think you or your child may have lactose intolerance, as the symptoms can be similar to other conditions. before seeing your gp, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what symptoms you experience. tell your gp if you notice any patterns, or if there are any foods you seem particularly sensitive to. your gp may suggest trying to\xa0remove lactose from your diet for two weeks to see if it helps to relieve your symptoms. this will provide further evidence\xa0of whether\xa0you’re lactose intolerant.'}, {'further testing': ' other tests aren’t usually needed, but your gp may sometimes suggest further tests to:help confirm the diagnosis find out how much lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose) your body is producing try to determine what might be causing your lactose intolerance some of the main tests that may be\xa0used\xa0are described below.'}, {'treating lactose intolerance': ' there’s no cure for lactose intolerance, but most people are able to control their symptoms by making changes to their diet. some cases of lactose intolerance, such as those caused by gastroenteritis, are only temporary and will improve within a few days or weeks. other cases, such as\xa0those caused by an inherited genetic fault or a long-term underlying condition, are likely to be lifelong.'}, {'changing your diet': ' in most cases, cutting down on or avoiding sources of lactose and replacing them with lactose-free alternatives is enough to control the symptoms of lactose intolerance. the exact changes you need to make to your diet depend on how sensitive you are to lactose. some people are able to tolerate some lactose in their diet without any problems, whereas others experience symptoms after consuming food containing only a tiny amount of lactose. if you decide to experiment with what you can and can’t eat, make sure\xa0to introduce new foods gradually, rather than all at once. this will help you to get used to any foods you might be sensitive to and identify any that cause problems. eating fewer products containing lactose, or avoiding them completely, can mean you miss out on certain vitamins and minerals in your diet and increase your risk of complications. you’ll also need to make sure you’re getting enough\xa0nutrition from either lacto-free foods or dietary supplements. if you or your child are extremely sensitive to lactose, talk to your gp about your diet. milk products are rich in calcium needed for healthy bones so you may need to have regular bone density checks. you may be referred to a dietitian (an expert in diet and nutrition) who\xa0can advise about what foods should be included in your, or your child’s, diet.'}, {'sources of lactose': ' some of the main sources of lactose you may need to cut down on or avoid if you’re lactose intolerant are described below.'}, {'lactose-free foods and drinks': ' there are a number of alternative foods and drinks available in supermarkets to replace the milk and dairy products you need to avoid. food and drinks that don’t usually contain lactose include:soya milks, yoghurts and some cheeses milks made from rice, oats, almonds, hazelnuts, coconut, quinoa, and potato foods which carry the ‘dairy-free’ or ‘suitable for vegans’ signs carob bars you can also buy cow’s milk containing additional lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose). this means you still get the nutritional benefits of the milk, but you’re less likely to experience any symptoms after consuming it.'}, {'getting enough calcium': ' if you’re unable to eat most dairy products, you may not be getting enough calcium in your daily diet.\xa0calcium has several important functions, including:helping build strong bones and teeth regulating muscle contractions (including heartbeat) ensuring blood clots normally therefore, it’s a good idea\xa0to choose lactose-free products with added calcium and ensure your diet contains alternative sources of calcium, such as:green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage and okra soya beans tofu nuts bread and anything made with fortified flour fish containing edible bones (for example, sardines, salmon, and pilchards) you can also buy combined calcium and vitamin d supplements from most pharmacists to help maintain good bone health. it’s important to check with your gp or dietitian whether you should be taking supplements, however, as taking excessively high levels of calcium can cause side effects.'}, {'lactase substitutes': ' in addition to dietary changes, you may also find it useful to take\xa0liquid drops, tablets or capsules that contain\xa0lactase substitutes. these are available from most health foods shops. lactase substitutes replace the lactase your small intestine isn’t producing, which\xa0can reduce your symptoms by helping your body break down any lactose in your diet more easily. lactase substitutes\xa0can either be added to milk\xa0or taken just\xa0before eating a meal containing lactose.'}, {'lactose intolerance in children': ' if your child is lactose intolerant, they may be able to consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing symptoms. this is quite safe, but you may need to experiment to find out how much they can comfortably eat or drink. if your child is unable to tolerate any lactose, your doctor\xa0may refer you to a dietitian for nutritional advice because it’s important\xa0for young children to have certain nutrients in their diet to ensure healthy growth and development. in general, the same rules about foods to try or to avoid are similar for children and adults (see above). for babies with lactose intolerance, lactose-free formula milk is available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets. however, soya formula isn’t recommended for children under six months because it contains hormones that may interfere with your baby’s future physical and sexual development. breastfed babies may benefit from lactase substitute drops to help their bodies digest the lactose in breast milk. for many children, lactose intolerance is only temporary and will improve after a few weeks. after this point it’s safe to gradually reintroduce milk and dairy products into their diet.'}, {'complications of lactose intolerance': ' milk and other dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet. they contain calcium, protein

number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. around 2 in every 3 cases affect men. over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the uk have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity.'}, {'diagnosis and screening': ' liver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a gp and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver. however, regular check-ups

condition’s stage.'}, {'staging liver cancer': ' staging is a term used to describe how far a particular cancer has spread. there are a number of different systems used to stage liver cancer. many liver cancer specialists use combination staging systems that include features of both the cancer and the underlying liver function to stage a person’s condition. this is because the length of time a person lives and how well they\xa0tolerate potential treatments will be determined not only by how advanced their cancer is, but also by their level of health and how good their underlying liver function is. one combination system for staging liver cancer is known as the barcelona clinic liver cancer (bclc) staging system. the bclc staging system consists of 5 stages. these are:stage 0 –\xa0the tumour is less than 2cm (20mm) in diameter and the person is very well and has normal liver function stage a –\xa0a single tumour has grown but is less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter, or there are 3 or fewer smaller tumours\xa0less than 3cm (30mm) in diameter and the person is very well with normal liver function stage b – there are multiple tumours in the liver, but the person is well and their liver function is unaffected stage c –\xa0any of the above circumstances, but the person is not so well and their liver function is not so good, or where the cancer has started to spread into the main blood vessel of the liver, nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body stage d –\xa0where the liver has lost most of its functioning abilities and the person begins to have symptoms of end-stage liver disease, such as a build-up of fluid inside their abdomen'}, {'treating liver cancer': ' the treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage of the condition. treatment can include surgery and medication.'}, {'cancer treatment teams': ' most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) to treat liver cancer. these are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment. deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.'}, {'your treatment plan': ' your recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage your liver cancer is at. if your cancer is at stage a when diagnosed, a complete cure may be possible. the 3 main ways this can be achieved are:removing the affected section of liver – known as a resection having a liver transplant – an operation to remove the liver and replace it with a healthy one using heat to kill cancerous cells – known as microwave or radiofrequency ablation (rfa) if your cancer is at stage b or c, a cure is not usually possible. however, chemotherapy can slow the progression of the cancer, relieve symptoms, and prolong life for months or, in some cases, years. there is also a medication called sorafenib that\xa0can help prolong life. if your cancer is at stage d when diagnosed, it is usually too late to slow down the spread of the cancer. instead, treatment focuses on relieving\xa0any\xa0symptoms of pain and discomfort you may have.'}, {'surgical resection': ' if damage to your liver is minimal and the cancer is contained in a small part of your liver, it may be possible to remove the cancerous cells during surgery. this procedure is known as surgical resection. as the liver can regenerate itself, it may be possible to remove a large section of it without seriously affecting your health. however, in the majority of people with liver cancer, their liver’s regenerative ability may be significantly impaired and resection may be unsafe. whether or not a resection can be performed is often determined by assessing the severity of your cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). if a liver resection is recommended, it will be carried out under a general anaesthetic, which means you will be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain as it is carried out. most people are well enough to leave hospital within a week or two of having surgery. however, depending on how much of your liver was removed, it may take several months for you to fully recover.'}, {'liver transplant': ' a liver transplant involves removing a cancerous liver and replacing it with a healthy\xa0liver from a donor. this is a major operation and there is a risk of potentially life-threatening complications. a liver transplant may be suitable for you if you:only have a single tumour less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter have 3 or fewer small tumours, each less than 3cm (30mm) have responded exceptionally well to other treatments, with no evidence of tumour growth for 6 months if you have multiple tumours or a tumour larger than 5cm, the risk of the cancer returning is usually so high that a liver transplant will be of no benefit. if you are suitable for a liver transplant, you will normally need to be placed on a waiting list until a donor liver becomes available. the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 142 days for adults. in some cases, a small part of the liver of a living relative can be used. this is known as a living donor liver transplant. the advantage of using a living donor liver transplant is that the person receiving the transplant can plan the procedure with their medical team and relative, and will not usually have to wait very long. read more about liver transplants.'}, {'microwave or radiofrequency ablation': ' microwave or radiofrequency ablation (rfa) may be recommended as an alternative to surgery to treat liver cancer at an early stage, ideally when the tumour or tumours are smaller than 5cm (50mm) in diameter. they can also be used to treat tumours larger than this, but the treatment may need to be repeated in such cases. these treatments involve heating the tumours with microwaves or radio waves produced by small, needle-like electrodes. this heat kills the cancer cells and causes the tumours to shrink. similar procedures using lasers or freezing can also achieve the same result. there are 3 main ways microwave ablation or rfa can be carried out:where the needles are passed through the skin (percutaneously) where the needles are inserted through small incisions in your abdomen\xa0– ‘keyhole’ surgery (laparoscopy) where the needles are inserted through a single large incision made in your abdomen\xa0– ‘open’ surgery continuous ultrasound or computerised tomography (ct) scans are used to make sure the needles are guided into the correct position. microwave ablation or rfa can be carried out under general anaesthetic or\xa0local anaesthetic (where you are awake but the area being treated is numbed), depending on the technique used and the size of the area being treated. how long it takes to carry out the treatment depends on the size and number of tumours being treated, but it usually takes between 1 and 3 hours in total. most people need to stay overnight in hospital. you may experience some minor discomfort and\xa0flu-like symptoms, such as chills and muscle pains, for a few days after the procedure. the risk of complications occurring with microwave ablation or rfa is low, but possible problems can include bleeding, infection, minor burns and damage to nearby organs.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy\xa0uses powerful cancer-killing medications to slow the spread of liver cancer. a type of chemotherapy called transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (tace) is usually recommended to treat cases of stage b and c liver cancer. in these cases,

anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area is numbed so you won’t feel any pain.'}, {'sorafenib': ' sorafenib is a medication given in tablet form that can disrupt the blood supply to liver tumours and slow down their growth. it is sometimes used as a treatment for advanced cases of liver cancer, although it is not routinely available on the nhs because the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has said the cost of the medication is high for the limited benefit it offers. whether or not you are eligible for sorafenib will be decided by your medical team,

hepatocellular carcinoma.'}, {'advanced liver cancer': ' treatment for advanced liver cancer focuses on relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort, rather than attempting to slow down the progression of the cancer. some people with advanced liver cancer require strong painkillers, such as codeine or possibly morphine. nausea and constipation are common side effects of these types of painkillers, so you may also be given an anti-sickness tablet and a laxative. read more about end of life care.'}, {'thank you': ' your feedback has been received'}]"
low blood pressure (hypotension),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/low-blood-pressure-hypotension/,"[{'about low blood pressure': ' low blood pressure –\xa0sometimes referred to as hypotension – is a condition where the arterial blood pressure is abnormally low. blood pressure is a measure of the force that your heart uses to pump blood around your body.'}, {'the heart': ' the heart is a muscle that is designed to pump a constant supply of blood around the body. when your heart beats, it pushes the blood around your body through blood vessels called arteries and capillaries. when your heart rests in between beats, the blood flows back to your heart through a network of veins and capillaries.'}, {'blood pressure': ' blood pressure is a measure of the force of the blood on the walls of the arteries as the blood flows through them. it is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmhg). when your blood pressure is measured, two measurements are recorded during a single heartbeat. the two measurements are known as the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure.systolic pressure\xa0– is the pressure when your heart beats and squeezes blood into your arteries. at this stage, the pressure in your arteries is at its highest. diastolic pressure\xa0– is the pressure when your heart rests in between beats and the blood flows back to your heart through your veins. at this stage, the pressure in your arteries is at its lowest your blood pressure reading will be given as two numbers, with your systolic reading first, followed by your diastolic reading. if your systolic blood pressure is 120 mmhg, and your diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmhg, your blood pressure is 120 over 80, which is commonly written as 120/80.'}, {'the highs and lows': ' as a general guide, the ideal blood pressure for a young, healthy adult is between 90/60 and 120/80. if you have a reading of 140/90, or more, you have\xa0high blood pressure\xa0(hypertension). this puts you at greater risk of serious health conditions, such as strokes or heart attacks. low blood pressure is also known as hypotension. people with a reading of around 90/60, or less, are commonly regarded as having low blood pressure. some people who have low blood pressure experience symptoms as a result of it. there may be an underlying cause that could need treatment.'}, {'symptoms of low blood pressure': ' on its own, low blood pressure (hypotension) does not always cause symptoms. if you have low blood pressure and you do not have any symptoms, you do not require treatment. however, low blood pressure can sometimes mean that there is not enough blood flowing to your brain and other vital organs. as a result, you may experience some of the following symptoms:dizziness fainting\xa0(a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness) light-headedness blurred vision palpitations (a rapid or irregular heartbeat) confusion nausea (feeling like you are going to be sick) general weakness if you experience the symptoms of hypotension after changing positions (for example, standing up), it is known as postural – or orthostatic – hypotension. if you experience these symptoms after eating, it is known as postprandial hypotension.'}, {'postural or orthostatic hypotension': ' postural or orthostatic hypotension occurs when your blood pressure falls after a sudden movement. for example, you may feel dizzy or faint after changing posture, such as sitting up from a lying position, or standing up from a sitting position. this may cause you to lose your balance and fall over. you may also feel light-headed, have blurred vision, or lose consciousness. the symptoms of postural or orthostatic hypotension should only last a few minutes as your blood pressure adjusts to your new position. this type of low blood pressure tends to affect people more as they get older when it can lead to more frequent falls. similar symptoms may also occur after exercise.'}, {'postprandial hypotension': ' your blood pressure can sometimes decrease (fall) after eating, causing dizziness, light-headedness, fainting and falls. this condition, known as postprandial hypotension, tends to occur more often in older people, particularly in those who have\xa0high blood pressure, or a condition such as\xa0parkinson’s disease, or\xa0diabetes. after a meal, your intestines need a large amount of blood for digestion. your heart rate increases and the blood vessels in other parts of your body constrict (narrow) to help maintain blood pressure. if your heart rate does not increase enough, or if your blood vessels do not constrict enough to maintain blood pressure, your blood pressure will fall. this can then cause symptoms.'}, {'causes of low blood pressure': ' throughout the day, your blood pressure can vary by between 30-40 mmhg (both systolic and diastolic) depending on what you are doing. having a stressful week at work, the temperature outside, and even what you had for lunch could affect your blood pressure reading. each time that you have your blood pressure measured, it is important that the test is carried out under similar conditions to ensure that the results are consistent. if you have a low blood pressure reading, your gp will first consider the everyday causes that might have affected it, before considering the possible underlying causes.'}, {'everyday causes': ' many factors have a daily, or sometimes even hourly, effect on your heart and circulation. below are things that could affect your blood pressure and, in some cases, may cause low blood pressure.the time of day\xa0– your blood pressure falls overnight so it will be low in the morning. your age\xa0– typically, blood pressure rises as you get older, although postural, or orthostatic, and postprandial hypotension are also more likely in the elderly. how stressed or relaxed you are\xa0– if you are stressed, your heart will beat faster and your blood pressure will increase, and the opposite if you are relaxed. how much exercise you do\xa0– initially, exercise will raise your blood pressure, but if you are healthy and exercise regularly, your blood pressure will be low when you are resting. your temperature\xa0– if you are cold, your heartbeat will slow down, and your blood pressure will fall. if you have recently eaten\xa0– blood will be used for digesting food in your stomach, so the blood pressure elsewhere in your body will fall.'}, {'underlying causes': ' if your blood pressure is still considered low after taking into account everyday factors such as those listed above, there may be another cause. some possibilities are explained below.'}, {'other causes': ' other possible causes of low blood pressure are:rare nerve conditions\xa0– if the nerves in your legs are affected, you may experience a severe drop in blood pressure when you stand up (postural or orthostatic hypotension). increasing age\xa0– as you get older, your arteries can become stiffer. if they do not constrict (get smaller), your blood pressure may drop, particularly when you stand up. pregnancy\xa0– during the early to mid stages of pregnancy, low blood pressure is fairly common. prolonged bed rest\xa0– low blood pressure may possibly occur as a result of moving less and having overall less nervous system activity. dehydration\xa0– low blood pressure may occur following particularly severe\xa0dehydration from vomiting and diarrhoea because the lack of water and salt in your body will reduce the volume of your blood. your genes\xa0– some research has suggested that low blood pressure is genetic. if your parents have low blood pressure, it is possible that you could inherit it from them.'}, {'diagnosing low blood pressure': ' low blood pressure (hypotension) can be easily diagnosed by measuring your blood pressure.'}, {'measuring blood pressure': ' a blood pressure reading is taken using two measurements. the first measurement is known as systolic, which is the pressure in your arteries when your heart contracts and pushes the blood around your body. the second measurement is known as diastolic, which is the pressure in your arteries when your heart refills with blood in between heartbeats. both systolic and diastolic blood pressures are measured in millimetres of mercury (mmhg).'}, {'what is low blood pressure?': ' as a general guide, low blood pressure is a reading of 90/60 or less. however, it is not necessary for both your systolic and diastolic readings to be in this range for it to be considered low blood pressure. for example, a reading of 80/65 would be considered low because the systolic number is in the low range, and 100/55 would also be considered as low because the diastolic number is in the low range. if you have low blood pressure according to this guide, you do not need to worry. having low blood pressure is considered healthy as it protects you from the risks and diseases of high blood pressure. you will only need to have treatment if you are experiencing symptoms as a result of your low blood pressure.'}, {'postural or orthostatic hypotension': ' if your symptoms of low blood pressure mostly occur when you change position (postural or orthostatic hypotension), then your blood pressure may be measured before and after you move. for example, your blood pressure may be measured while you are sitting down and again while you are standing up. depending on what your seated blood pressure was, if your systolic reading drops by between 15-30 mmhg when you stand up, you may have orthostatic hypotension.'}, {'underlying causes': ' your gp or practice nurse will usually be able to diagnose low blood pressure very easily. however, determining the reason for low blood pressure can be more difficult. if you have an underlying condition that is causing low blood pressure, it is likely that you will have other symptoms as well. you should discuss these with your gp who may recommend that you have further tests.'}, {'treating low blood pressure': ' if you have low blood pressure (hypotension), but you do not have any symptoms, you do not require treatment. if you are experiencing symptoms, your gp will try to establish the underlying cause of your hypotension in order to determine what treatment is necessary.'}, {'medication': ' if you are taking medication, and your gp suspects that it may be causing low blood pressure, they will probably recommend a change of medication or alter your dose. this includes medication to treat\xa0high blood pressure\xa0(hypertension) and medication to treat\xa0parkinson’s disease. your blood pressure will be monitored while you are taking medication and any changes will be noted by your gp or practice nurse. if you are experiencing side effects from taking medication, you should discuss this with your gp.'}, {'underlying illnesses or conditions': ' if your gp suspects that a disorder – such as a heart condition, adrenal gland failure or a nerve condition – is causing your low blood pressure, you may be referred to hospital for further tests and treatment. if adrenal gland failure is found to be causing your low blood pressure, your gp may prescribe fludrocortisone to replace the missing hormone, aldosterone. this will usually be in tablet form and will need to be taken for life. if a nerve condition is causing your low blood pressure, it can be more difficult to treat. you may be prescribed medication in order to help stimulate your nervous system.'}, {'fluids and salt': ' dehydration\xa0– when the water and salt content of your body is reduced –\xa0can cause low blood pressure. increasing your fluid and salt intake can easily treat this. ensuring that you drink enough fluid – at least eight glasses a day – will help with hypotension. this is because more fluids will increase the volume of your blood, and having more blood in your arteries will increase your blood pressure. while people who have high blood pressure are usually advised to restrict their salt intake, if you have low blood pressure, you may be advised to include more salt in your diet. your gp will be able to advise you about how much additional salt you need, and whether you can add salt to your usual food, or if you need to take salt tablets.'}, {'general advice': ' the following general advice will help to limit your symptoms of your hypotension, particularly postural or orthostatic hypotension.stand up gradually, particularly first thing in the morning. it may also be useful to try some other physical movements first to increase your heart rate and the flow of blood around your body. for example, stretching in bed before you get up, or crossing and uncrossing your legs if you are seated and about to stand. wear support stockings\xa0– sometimes called compression stockings. these are tight-fitting elastic socks or tights. they provide extra pressure to your feet, legs and abdomen, which will help stimulate your circulation and increase your blood pressure. raise the head of your bed\xa0or use extra pillows under your head. this will increase the flow of blood in your body and will also make it easier when you need to get up. avoid caffeine at night and limit your alcohol\xa0intake\xa0– this will help you to avoid dehydration, which can cause low blood pressure. eat small frequent meals, rather than large ones\xa0– this will help you to prevent postprandial hypotension (low blood pressure after you have eaten). lying down after eating or sitting still for a while may also help. very few people are prescribed medication for hypotension. the symptoms of hypotension can be usually be treated by making these small changes to your lifestyle and, in particular, by increasing your fluid and salt intake. if medication is necessary, it will usually be medicines to expand the volume of your blood, or to constrict (narrow) your arteries. by increasing your blood, or decreasing your arteries, your blood pressure will increase, as there will be more blood flowing through a smaller space.'}, {'thank

85% of all cases. tobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can\xa0lead to\xa0the development of cancer. these substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing). if you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker. while smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as oesophageal cancer and mouth cancer. these products include:cigars pipe tobacco snuff (a powdered form of tobacco) chewing tobacco smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco.\xa0while they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer. it’s been\xa0estimated that smoking 4 joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes. even smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. this is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer.'}, {'passive smoking': ' if you don’t smoke, frequent exposure to other people’s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer. for example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner.'}, {'radon': ' radon is a

(non-small-cell or small-cell cancer) the size and position of the cancer how far advanced your cancer is (the stage) your overall health deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours. the main treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, you may receive a combination of these treatments.'}, {'your treatment plan': ' your treatment plan depends on whether you have non-small-cell lung cancer or small-cell lung cancer.'}, {'surgery': ' there are\xa03\xa0 types of lung cancer surgery:lobectomy –\xa0where\xa0one\xa0or more large parts of the lung (called lobes) are removed – your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in 1 section of 1 lung pneumonectomy – where the entire lung is removed – this is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung wedge resection or segmentectomy – where a small piece of the lung is removed (this procedure is\xa0only suitable for a small number of patients, as it is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung – this is\xa0usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer) people are naturally concerned that they won’t\xa0be able to breathe if some or all of a lung is removed, but it’s possible to breathe normally with 1 lung. however, if you have breathing problems before the operation, such as breathlessness, it’s likely that these symptoms will continue after surgery.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses pulses of radiation to destroy cancer cells. there are a number of ways it can be used to treat people with lung cancer. an intensive course of radiotherapy, known as radical radiotherapy, can be used to try to cure non-small-cell lung cancer if the person isn’t healthy enough for surgery. for very small tumours, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery. radiotherapy can also be used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn’t possible (this is known as palliative radiotherapy). a type of radiotherapy known as prophylactic cranial irradiation (pci) is also sometimes used during the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. pci involves treating the whole brain with a low dose of radiation. it’s used as a preventative measure because there’s a risk that small-cell lung cancer will spread to your brain. the 3 main\xa0ways that radiotherapy can be given are described below:conventional external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to direct beams of radiation at affected parts of your body stereotactic radiotherapy – a more accurate type of external beam radiotherapy where several high-energy beams are used to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumour, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue as much as possible internal radiotherapy – a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into your lung – a\xa0small piece of radioactive material is placed inside the catheter and positioned against the site of the tumour before being removed after a few minutes for lung cancer, external beam radiotherapy is used more often than internal radiotherapy, particularly if it’s thought that a cure is possible. stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to treat tumours that are very small, as it’s more effective than standard radiotherapy alone in these circumstances. internal radiotherapy only tends to be used as a palliative treatment when the cancer is blocking or partly blocking your airway.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medication to treat cancer. there are several different ways that chemotherapy can be used to treat lung cancer. for example, it can be:given before surgery to shrink a tumour, which can increase the chance of successful surgery\xa0(this is usually only done as part of a clinical trial) given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning used to relieve symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn’t possible combined with radiotherapy chemotherapy treatments are usually given in cycles. a cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to let your body recover from the effects of the treatment. the number of cycles of chemotherapy you need will depend on the type and the grade of your lung cancer. most people require four to 6 courses of treatment over 3 to 6 months. chemotherapy for lung cancer involves taking a combination of different medications. the medications are usually delivered through a drip into a vein (intravenously), or into a tube connected to one of the blood vessels in your chest. some people may be given capsules or tablets to swallow instead.'}, {'other treatments': ' as well as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there are a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to treat lung cancer.'}, {'living with lung cancer': ' breathlessness is common in people who have lung cancer, whether it is a symptom of the condition or a side effect of treatment. in\xa0many cases, breathlessness can be\xa0improved with some simple measures such as:breathing in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth (after treatment for lung cancer, you may see a physiotherapist, who can teach you some simple breathing exercises) making daily activities easier – for example, using a trolley when you go shopping or keeping things you often need downstairs so you don’t need to regularly walk up and down the stairs using a fan to direct cool air towards your face eating smaller and more frequent meals, and taking smaller mouthfuls if\xa0measures like these aren’t enough to control your breathlessness, you may need further treatment.\xa0there are a number of medications that can help improve breathlessness. home oxygen treatment\xa0may be an option in more severe cases. if your breathlessness is caused by another condition, such as a chest infection or\xa0a fluid build-up around the lungs (a pleural

for advice. left untreated, the tissue can die, which is known as gangrene (specifically, dry gangrene). the symptoms of dry gangrene normally begin with a red line on the skin that marks the edges of the affected tissue. the tissue becomes cold and numb, and can be painful as the tissue dies. however, many people, particularly the elderly, experience no sensations. the affected area changes colour from red, to brown, to black. the dead tissue will then shrivel up, separate from the healthy tissue and fall off. these complications normally require admission to hospital, where you’ll be given

synovial sarcomas, soft tissue ewing’s sarcoma and fibrosarcomas. these are the most common types in teenagers. if you have a different type and want to know more,\xa0contact macmillan. if you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general\xa0soft tissue sarcoma section. soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. there are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are:rhabdomyosarcomas synovial sarcomas soft tissue ewing’s sarcoma fibrosarcomas sarcomas can also develop in the bones. this is called osteosarcoma.'}, {'signs and symptoms of soft tissue sarcomas': ' the symptoms of a sarcoma will depend on where it is:if it’s in an arm or leg, symptoms include a lump or swelling in the limb – this is usually painless, but not always if it’s in the tummy (abdomen), symptoms include a painful, swollen tummy, and problems going to the toilet to poo (called constipation) if it’s in your bladder, symptoms include pain in the lower tummy, finding it difficult to pee (pass urine), and having blood in your pee if it’s in the chest, symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough and pain in your chest if it’s in the head or neck, symptoms include a lump, a blockage and discharge from the nose or throat;\xa0occasionally an eye may become swollen and stick out a bit you may also have other symptoms, such as tiredness, loss of appetite or weight loss. remember – most people with these symptoms won’t have a sarcoma. \xa0but if you have any of these symptoms, or are worried that you may have a sarcoma, the first thing to do is to speak to your gp. they’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.'}, {'causes': ' it’s unknown what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults. people often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this. remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.'}, {'the soft tissue': ' the soft tissues of the body connect, surround and support other body tissue and organs. soft tissue includes muscle, cartilage, fat, fibrous tissue, nerves and blood vessels.'}, {'types of soft tissue sarcoma': ' soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. there are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are:rhabdomyosarcomas synovial sarcomas fibrosarcomas there are also bone sarcomas. doctors can tell the type of soft tissue sarcoma by closely examining the sample of tissue that’s been removed (called a biopsy) under a microscope.'}, {'causes': ' it’s unknown\xa0what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults. remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer. some rare conditions that run in families (known as genetic conditions) can increase the chance (risk) of getting a soft tissue sarcoma. you would usually know if anyone in your family had one of these conditions. people who had radiotherapy for another type of cancer when they were a child may have an increased risk of developing a sarcoma in later life – this would be from their teens onwards. people often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this. if you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general\xa0soft tissue sarcoma information.'}, {'tests for soft tissue sarcomas': ' there are some tests you might have at your gp surgery or at the hospital. these tests will help the doctors see whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma.'}, {'visiting your gp': ' if you think you might have some of the symptoms of a soft tissue sarcoma, you should go to your gp. they’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms, and they can arrange tests to find out more. they’ll examine you and usually arrange for some tests, such as x-rays. there may be a number of reasons why you’re feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. if your gp can’t find the cause, you’ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.'}, {'at the hospital': ' to begin with, you may see a specialist at a general hospital for more tests. if your gp suspects you have a soft tissue sarcoma, they may refer you directly to a sarcoma specialist. if you’re diagnosed with a sarcoma and you’re not already seeing a specialist, you’ll be referred to one. you’ll probably see a lot of doctors, nurses and other staff. your hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the\xa0following tests, which macmillan have information on:x-rays bone scans ultrasound scans mri, ct or pet scans biopsies bone marrow tests you won’t necessarily need all of these tests.'}, {'treating soft tissue sarcomas': ' this section is for teenagers and young adults. it’s about treatment for a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma. there are different types of soft tissue sarcoma, and the information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas and fibrosarcomas, which are the most common types in teenagers. if you have a different type and want to know more, please contact macmillan. the 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. most people have a combination of treatments. your doctors will plan your treatment based on:the\xa0type of sarcoma you have the stage of the cancer (how big it is and whether it has spread from where it started) the grade of the cancer (how fast-growing the cancer cells are). if you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. they’ll be happy to help you understand what’s involved. if you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue ewing’s sarcoma, it’s treated in the same way as a ewing’s sarcoma in a bone.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' this is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. for soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy can be given in a number of situations:before surgery – to shrink the tumour after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, and to treat cancer cells that have spread when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation for soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy\xa0is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a picc line. you can find out more about\xa0chemotherapy\xa0and how it’s given. you’ll have chemotherapy\xa0over a few days, then you’ll have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. the days you have the chemotherapy\xa0and the rest period afterwards are called a cycle. most people have several cycles of chemotherapy. you’ll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy, but it’s often possible to have part of your treatment as an outpatient. different chemotherapy drugs are used for soft tissue sarcomas, and you’ll usually have 2 or 3 drugs in combination. this is sometimes called a regimen or treatment plan. your doctor will decide which regimen or treatment plan is best for you depending on the grade and stage of your sarcoma. you may have chemotherapy treatment as part of a clinical research trial. it will be your decision whether or not you take part in a trial. your doctor will explain it fully before you make the choice if there is a trial that is right for you. some of the main chemotherapy drugs for soft tissue sarcomas are:ifosfamide vincristine actinomycin d doxorubicin cyclophosphamide cisplatin if you have a rhabdomyosarcoma, you may be given ifosfamide, vincristine and actinomycin. giving these drugs together is called iva. you might also be given ifosfamide, vincristine actinomycin and doxorubicin. giving these drugs together is called ivado. macmillan have more information about chemotherapy, including information about\xa0individual drugs and combinations of drugs, iva and ivado chemotherapy. this is written for anyone who’s looking for information about chemotherapy, not just for young adults. other types of soft tissue sarcoma can be treated with different combinations of drugs, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, or vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide. your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about the type of chemotherapy you’re going to have and how many cycles you’ll need.'}, {'surgery': ' surgery to remove the cancer is one of the main treatments for soft tissue sarcomas. your surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, and at the same time reduce any long-term effects as much as possible. the operation you have will depend on the size of the sarcoma and where it is in your body. you might meet other people with the same type of sarcoma who have had a different operation. everyone is different. your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand why you need to have it and what’s involved. below are some of the different types of operation you might have for a soft tissue sarcoma. we also have more information about what will happen before and after the operation in our surgery section.'}, {'amputation': ' very occasionally the only way to get rid of the cancer is to remove the limb where the sarcoma is growing. this is called an amputation and it’s only ever done if there is no alternative.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. there’s more information about it in the\xa0radiotherapy section. for soft tissue sarcomas radiotherapy can be given in a number of situations:after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area, or to get rid of any cancer cells that may be left behind; you’ll usually have it about 4 to 6 weeks after the operation, when your wound has healed before surgery – to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with an operation when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation radiotherapy is generally given every weekday (monday to friday). each treatment takes a few minutes.'}, {'living with a soft tissue sarcoma': ' this information is about life after having surgery for a soft tissue sarcoma. you may find it useful to read the information about surgery first.'}, {'life after limb-sparing surgery': ' the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. the best person to ask about your operation is your surgeon. after limb-sparing surgery the limb might not work as well as it used to. physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. you’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. these can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them.'}, {'joint replacements': ' if you’ve had a joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim and do most of the things you could do before, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. these activities could damage or loosen the new joint. check with your surgeon about any special instructions they may have for what activities you can do. if you’ve had a shoulder replacement you might find it harder to lift your arm above your shoulder. after any kind of joint replacement, you will be given physiotherapy. it’s very important to do the exercises your physiotherapist shows you so that you get as much movement back as possible.'}, {'life after amputation': ' after amputation most people have an artificial limb, called a prosthesis. there are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports. different types of prosthesis let you do different things. some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.'}, {'how will i feel?': ' you might feel lots of different emotions. you might be tearful, angry, fed up or depressed at times. you might think you’ve lost all your confidence and that you’ll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. these feelings are normal, and it’s important that you get support to help you cope with them. you could talk to:family or friends a counsellor – this can be arranged by your doctor or nurse other young people in a similar situation things will be tough as you get used to living with an amputation, but help is available. other people’s reactions can be hard to cope with, too. you might be worried about what your friends think or how they’re going to treat you. the thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful. try to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends you can call on when things get you down. you might also find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like a counsellor. most people find it helps to talk about how they’re feeling or what’s on their mind. if you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general\xa0soft tissue

type of cancer. the initial\xa0symptoms of stomach cancer are vague and easy to mistake for other less serious\xa0conditions.\xa0they include:persistent\xa0indigestion and heartburn trapped wind and frequent burping feeling very full or bloated after meals persistent stomach pain symptoms of advanced stomach cancer can include:blood in your stools, or black stools loss of appetite weight loss as the early\xa0symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to those of many other\xa0conditions, the cancer is often advanced by the time it’s diagnosed. it’s therefore important to get any possible symptoms of stomach cancer checked by your gp as soon as possible. read more about diagnosing stomach cancer'}, {'who’s affected': ' the exact cause of stomach cancer is still unclear, although you’re more likely to develop it if you:are male are 55 years of age or older smoke have a diet low in fibre and high in processed food or red meat have a diet that contains a lot of salted and pickled foods have a stomach infection caused by helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) bacteria read more about the causes of stomach cancer.'}, {'types of stomach cancer': ' there are several different types of stomach cancer. more than 95% of stomach cancers develop in the cells of the stomach lining and are known as adenocarcinomas. less common types of stomach cancer include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue (tissue that drains away fluid and helps fight infection), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (gists), which develop in the muscle or connective tissue of the stomach wall.'}, {'how stomach cancer is treated': ' many cases of stomach cancer can’t be completely cured, but it’s still possible to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life using chemotherapy\xa0and in some cases\xa0radiotherapy and surgery. if operable, surgery can cure stomach cancer as long as all of the cancerous tissue\xa0can be removed. surgery to remove some or all of the stomach is known as a\xa0gastrectomy. it will still be possible to eat normally after a gastrectomy, but you’ll probably have to adjust the size of your portions. chemotherapy can also be used before surgery to help shrink the tumour and sometimes after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning. read more about treating stomach cancer'}, {'living with stomach cancer': ' living with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social, psychological and financial support. read more about living with stomach cancer'}, {'symptoms of stomach cancer': ' many symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to less serious conditions, so it can be difficult to recognise in the early stages. early stage symptoms include:persistent indigestion trapped wind and frequent burping heartburn feeling full very quickly when eating feeling bloated after eating feeling sick pain in your stomach or breastbone difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) vomiting (the vomit may be streaked with blood), although this is uncommon in the early stages'}, {'advanced stomach cancer': ' symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer include:blood in your stools, or black stools loss of appetite weight loss tiredness lumpiness and swelling in your stomach (caused by a build-up of fluid) anaemia\xa0(a reduced number of red blood cells that can cause you to feel tired and breathless) yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)'}, {'when to seek medical help': ' stomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it’s diagnosed early. it’s therefore\xa0important for your gp to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected. stomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age. indigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. however, it’s unlikely that someone with indigestion who’s under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer. however,\xa0see your gp if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. they\xa0should refer you to a specialist for further testing. also see your gp if you have difficulty swallowing. this\xa0isn’t a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated. read more about diagnosing stomach cancer'}, {'causes of stomach cancer': ' stomach cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the stomach, although it’s unclear exactly why these changes occur. cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means cells grow and reproduce\xa0uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system (a network of vessels and glands called lymph nodes located throughout the body). once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it’s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs. it’s not known what triggers the\xa0changes in dna\xa0that lead to stomach cancer and why only a small number of people develop the condition.'}, {'increased risk': ' however, evidence suggests that a number of different factors can affect your\xa0chances of developing stomach cancer.'}, {'smoking': ' people who smoke are about twice as likely to develop stomach cancer compared with non-smokers. this is because you swallow some cigarette smoke when you inhale and it ends up in your stomach. cigarettes contain\xa0harmful chemicals which can damage the cells in your stomach. the more you smoke and the longer you’ve been smoking, the bigger the risk.\xa0in the uk, around 1\xa0in every 5 cases of stomach cancer (20%) is thought to be caused by smoking.'}, {'how stomach cancer spreads': ' there are 3 ways stomach cancer can spread:directly –\xa0the cancer can spread from the stomach into nearby tissues and organs, such as the pancreas, colon, small intestine and peritoneum (the lining of the inside of the abdominal cavity) through\xa0the lymphatic system – the lymphatic system is a series of glands (nodes) located throughout your body, similar to the blood circulatory system; the glands produce specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection through\xa0the blood –\xa0which can cause the cancer to spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, most commonly the liver stomach cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic stomach cancer.'}, {'diagnosing stomach cancer': ' speak to your gp as soon as possible if you have stomach cancer symptoms such as indigestion, unexpected weight loss, anaemia and persistent vomiting. your gp will ask about your symptoms and examine your stomach for any lumpiness or tenderness. if they think that stomach cancer may be a possibility they’ll refer you to a specialist for further investigation. in 2015, the\xa0national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and\xa0symptoms of stomach cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\xa0find out who should be referred for further tests for suspected stomach cancer.'}, {'hospital tests': ' if your gp thinks you may have stomach cancer, they’ll refer you to a specialist for tests. these may include a blood test and chest\xa0x-ray, which will assess your overall health. a sample of your stools may also be tested for blood. because of\xa0the potentially serious nature of stomach cancer, you should be referred to the specialist within 2 weeks. read more about waiting times.'}, {'further testing': ' if you’re diagnosed with stomach cancer, further tests may be needed to help determine how far it’s spread and how quickly it’s likely to spread (known as the stage and grade). your cancer specialist (oncologist) will discuss this with you. however, it may not always be possible to identify the exact stage of your condition until your treatment starts.'}, {'staging and grading': ' after all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell what stage and grade of stomach cancer you have. staging is a measurement of how far cancer has spread. there are a number of different ways stomach cancer can be staged.\xa0one method uses a numbering system from 1 to 4. the higher the number, the further the cancer has spread. the majority of stomach cancers are at stage 3 or 4 when diagnosed, which means a cure isn’t\xa0usually possible. grading describes how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. there are 3 grades of stomach cancer:low-grade – the cancer tends to grow slowly medium-grade – the cancer grows a bit\xa0faster high-grade – the cancer is aggressive and likely to grow quickly cancer research uk has more information about the staging and grading of stomach cancer.'}, {'treating stomach cancer': ' the treatments recommended for stomach cancer will depend on your general health and how far the cancer has spread. most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams made up of a number of different specialists (see below) who work together to plan and carry out\xa0the best treatment, tailored to your circumstances. feel free to discuss treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions.'}, {'your treatment plan': ' the main treatments for stomach cancer are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. you may have 1 of these treatments or a combination. if surgery is recommended, you may have chemotherapy beforehand. if the tumour is in the upper part of your stomach, including the junction between the oesophagus and stomach, you may also have radiotherapy prior to surgery. surgery is mainly used if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy tend to be used when the condition is diagnosed at a later stage. where possible, the primary aim of treatment is to completely\xa0remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.\xa0it’s estimated that a cure is possible in 20 to 30% of stomach cancer cases. if it’s not possible to remove the tumour, your doctors will focus on trying to prevent it from getting any bigger and causing further harm to your body. this may be done using surgery or chemotherapy. in some cases, it’s not possible to eliminate the cancer or slow it down. in this case, your treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible, usually with surgery or radiotherapy. a relatively new medication called\xa0trastuzumab (see below) can also be used to treat some types of advanced stomach cancer. your healthcare team will talk to you about which treatments are most suitable.'}, {'surgery': ' if you’re diagnosed with stomach cancer at an early stage,\xa0it may be possible for the cancer to be completely removed during surgery. in some cases, it may be possible to pass a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your oesophagus (gullet),\xa0rather than making incisions in your tummy. this is known as endoscopic surgery, and can be used to\xa0remove a sample of the tumour for testing (biopsy). it can also be used to remove the tumour completely if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. however, if your cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it completely. if this is the case, you may still have surgery to remove any cancer blocking your stomach, to ease your symptoms. this will depend on whether your symptoms can be controlled and the risks and side effects of undertaking major surgery. any type of surgery for stomach cancer will involve a large operation and a long recovery time. if you have stomach cancer surgery, you’ll usually need to stay in hospital for around 2 weeks. you’ll also need several weeks at home to recover.'}, {'chemotherapy': ' chemotherapy is a specialist treatment for cancer that uses medicines, called cytotoxic medicines,\xa0to stop cancer cells dividing and multiplying. as it circulates through your body, the medicine can target cancer cells in your stomach and any that may have spread to other parts of your body. you may have chemotherapy for stomach cancer before surgery to reduce the amount of cancer that has to be removed during the operation. chemotherapy can also be used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back. chemotherapy can also help to slow the progression of cancer and ease the symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer, which may not be suitable for surgery. if may be given orally (as tablets) or intravenously (by injection or a drip through a vein directly into your bloodstream), or a combination of both. intravenous chemotherapy is usually given in hospital, while oral chemotherapy is taken at home. chemotherapy is often given in cycles, each usually lasting about three weeks. alternatively, chemotherapy may be administered through a small pump, which gives you a constant low dose over a few weeks or months. the pumps are portable and can be worn at home, which means fewer trips to hospital.'}, {'radiotherapy': ' radiotherapy uses beams of high energy\xa0radiation to destroy cancer cells. it’s not often used to treat stomach cancer because there’s a risk that other organs close to your stomach might be damaged by the treatment. however, if you have advanced stomach cancer that’s causing pain or bleeding,\xa0you may need to have radiotherapy. in some cases, following surgery, you may have chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to help prevent the stomach cancer from recurring. if a cancer is bleeding slowly and causing anaemia, a single fraction of radiotherapy can be used to try to prevent further bleeding. if you need radiotherapy, your treatment will usually begin 2 or 3 months after surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. this is a painless procedure where you lie under a radiotherapy machine while it directs radiation at your stomach. you’ll be positioned by a radiographer (a specialist in radiotherapy) so that the machine targets the cancer cells and avoids as much healthy tissue as possible. radiotherapy often involves having treatment sessions 5 days a week. each session will only last a few minutes. the radiation doesn’t stay in your system afterwards, and it’s perfectly safe to be around others between your treatments. how long you’ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on how it’s used. radiotherapy used after surgery to help prevent stomach cancer coming back usually lasts 5 weeks. if it’s being used to control symptoms of advanced stomach cancer, it may only last 1 or 2 weeks.'}, {'trastuzumab': ' trastuzumab\xa0(sold under the brand name herceptin) is a medication\xa0used to treat\xa0breast cancer and some cases of advanced stomach cancer. some stomach cancers are stimulated by a type of protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2). trastuzumab works by blocking the effects of this protein. this doesn’t cure stomach cancer, but\xa0it can slow its growth and increase survival time. if you’re diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and tests show high levels of the her2 protein in the cancerous cells, your doctors may recommend treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab. trastuzumab is given intravenously, through a drip, and you’ll have the treatment in hospital. each treatment session takes up to 1 hour and you’ll usually need a session once every 3 weeks. trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. therefore, it may not be suitable if you have a heart problem such as angina, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart valve disease. if you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll also need regular tests on your heart to check for any problems. other side effects of trastuzumab may include:an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever diarrhoea tiredness aches and pains'}, {'living with stomach
